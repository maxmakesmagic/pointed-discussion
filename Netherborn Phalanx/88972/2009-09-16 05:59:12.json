I remember winning with it a seemingly lost game against a growing army of flyers off a Leafdrake Roost and praying for the last creature needed to come out for my opponent so I can finish him with this card. What's more, you can \"tutor\" with it another 6 mana bomb from your deck ( playing more 6 mana cards in a limited deck isn't always a great idea though) - [Hex](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex), for example, is in the same format. Really an excellent card, only sometimes a bit unfair.",
