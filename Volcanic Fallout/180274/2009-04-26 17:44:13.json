I smashed Faeries the first three times i played em because of fallout and i never even got to use my Banfires. The biggest deal about this card is the 2 damage that can't be countered. When you play burn like i do the game is always determined by 1 or 2 life, now i have the answer. I'll use fallout with no creatures out if its late game and my opponnets bellow 5 life. Good luck Faeries your gonna need more than luck, your gonna need cards you don't have. LOL",
