Time Spiral is my favorite set of all time, too, and triple TSP (I was just busy when FUT came out, so I didn't get to draft much TSP-PLC-FUT, but that seemed awesome too) is my favorite draft format ever too.  I taught my then-girlfriend, now-wife how to play using Time Spiral cards, and she had no problem with Suspend (though admittedly, the rest of the set was a bit overwhelming for her, and Magic didn't really stick with her until we playing with a bunch of 10th edition cards).  While I don't remember ever seeing a Plated Pegasus in play, per se, I hope that design and R&amp;D realize that this block was HUGELY popular with a great number of people, and don't continue to write the block off as a mistake.</span>\n<div class=\"postDetails\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_recentPosts_postsRepeater_ctl06_postDetails\" style=\"padding-top: 5px;\">\n<div class=\"reportAbuse\">\n<a href=\"http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php?p_prods=522,706,739&amp;p_cats=\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_recentPosts_postsRepeater_ctl06_reportAbuseLink\">\r\n                                    Report Abuse</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n                                    \r\n                            </div>\n<div class=\"postedBy\">\r\n                                Posted By: <a class=\"postedByLink\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" id=\"PostedBy35353\">dragonstout</a>\r\n                                (10/19/2010 11:11:26 AM)\r\n                            </div>\n<div class=\"postRating\">\n<div class=\"postRatingLabel\">\r\n                                    Rating:\u00a0\r\n                                </div>\n<div style=\"float: left;\">\n<div class=\"starRating\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_recentPosts_postsRepeater_ctl06_postRating_starRating\"><img alt=\"0.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"1.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"1.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"2.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"2.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"3.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"3.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"4.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"4.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"5.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.gif\"/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"postRating\">\n<div class=\"postRatingLabel\">\r\n                                    \u00a0\r\n                                </div>\n<div style=\"float: left;\">\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n</div>"
