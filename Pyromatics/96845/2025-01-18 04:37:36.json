No reason to play this without an infinite combo.

RDW is supposed to be the perennial non-combo answer to combo, and if even Red falls back on Combo as Green already has, then the entire game will be combo forever.

Fireball is more flexible in the fact it costs less to deal a lot of damage to one target, but Pyromantics has its own advantage in being able to distribute the damage more freely rather than dividing and rounding.<br/><br/>Agree that none of that still makes it a good burn spell, but those saying it's the worst ever or giving it a 0.5 rating are very muc... <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" onclick=\"ExpandPost(event, this, 334590)\">(see all)</a></span>\n<div class=\"postDetails\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_popularPosts_postsRepeater_ctl05_postDetails\" style=\"padding-top: 5px;\">\n<div class=\"reportAbuse\">\n<a href=\"http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php?p_prods=522,706,739&amp;p_cats=\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_popularPosts_postsRepeater_ctl05_reportAbuseLink\" onclick=\"HandleReportPost(this, '334590'); return false;\">\r\n                                    Report Abuse</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\n<div class=\"postedBy\">\r\n                                Posted By: \r\n                                <span id=\"PostedBy71017\">Yukikah</span>\r\n                                (8/11/2013 3:38:06 PM)\r\n                            </div>\n<div class=\"postRating\">\n<div class=\"postRatingLabel\">\r\n                                    Rating:\u00a0\r\n                                </div>\n<div style=\"float: left;\">\n<div class=\"starRating\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_popularPosts_postsRepeater_ctl05_postRating_starRating\"><img alt=\"0.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.png\"/><img alt=\"1.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.png\"/><img alt=\"1.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.png\"/><img alt=\"2.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.png\"/><img alt=\"2.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.png\"/><img alt=\"3.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.png\"/><img alt=\"3.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.png\"/><img alt=\"4.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.png\"/><img alt=\"4.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.png\"/><img alt=\"5.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.png\"/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"postRating\">\n<div class=\"postRatingLabel\">\r\n                                    \u00a0\r\n                                </div>\n<div style=\"float: left;\">\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>"
