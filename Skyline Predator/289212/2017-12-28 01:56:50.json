For four mana you can get a cheaper creature with a very useful ability and it is even part of a better tribe. All you need to do is spend more money or have some lucky pulls. This sort of thing is really bad for the game and turns it into a pay to win model.  \nInterestingly, this card is not bad even in its current state. This can still ambush quite well and a 3/4 in the skies is a respectable threat. At six mana this card is just fine. You get 3/3's with flying and another ability all the time at five.",
