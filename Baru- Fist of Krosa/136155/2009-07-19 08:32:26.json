Thus, I'm creating oodles of Forest tokens, sometimes having as many as 4 or 5 coming in each turn. When I first played Baru in this deck I though he'd be decent, but not incredible. Very easily he allowed me to swing with 25 points of trampling damage with 2 creatures to end the game. It is simple to use him effectively, yet you can still do some absolutely hysterical things with him.",
