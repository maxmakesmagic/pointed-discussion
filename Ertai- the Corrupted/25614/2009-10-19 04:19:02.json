His ability is simply astounding, granted that you have several tokens in play or creatures (or enchantments) that you don't need, allowing you to control exactly what your opponent plays through-out the rest of the game. This definitely fits right in the with the esper colors; restrictive abilities that neutralize the opponent and allow you to control them. The only downside to Ertai is that if your not playing tokens or lost of enchantments then it can become quite difficult to use him effectively. Also Ertai's ability can only be played once per turn, but with cards like [Thousand-Year Elixir](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thousand-Year Elixir) and other untapping abilities this minor weakness can easily be overlooked.
