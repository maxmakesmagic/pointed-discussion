You probably shouldn't play any creatures, because your opponent will either use Damnation or Doom Blade or something like that. Then you've paid mana for effectively nothing. And don't play clamp either, it dies to Naturalise. And man, wouldn't you know it, but your opponent has about half the power in a magic game; they'll pick a lot of the outcomes. Pretty bunk odds. Plus, if your opponent is playing control, he'll just kill/counter all of your stuff. You might as well throw in the towel. Not like your top-decked birds of paradise is helping you out.",
