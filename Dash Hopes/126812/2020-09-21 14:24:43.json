Because board position is paramount and the opponent's life total relatively unimportant to a control deck, this card would only be useful in a mono-black beatdown. And because a beatdown deck does not want to leave mana open, this is probably going to be the last card in your hand. That means that if your opponent is also playing a fast deck, they probably won't be playing vital spells at the same time that you have mana open.

I really don't mind.<br/>As has been said, in my experience with this card, the opponent will often end up making a bad decision and putting themselves further behind.<br/><br/>If you want 100% reliable counter spell, this is obviously not the spell you want.<br/><br/>But a bad card? I think you're wrong there.
