These days, Draw-Go doesn't really exist anymore and the card disadvantage would probably leave a bad taste in people's mouths. Cards can't really be judged in a vacuum- environment is everything. A card could be absolutely fantastic, but if it doesn't have the proper support, it's just an orphan.  \n  \nThat said, I still think Masticore is awesome.
