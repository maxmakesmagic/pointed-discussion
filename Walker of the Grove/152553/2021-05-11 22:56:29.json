When an evoke creature is cast (regardless of if its evoke cost was paid) there are 2 triggers when it enters the battlefield. The first is the obvious enters/leaves the battlefield ability, and the second is the trigger \"when this permanent enters the battlefield, if its evoke cost was paid, its controller sacrifices it\". The two triggers are put onto the stack at the same time, in whatever order you choose - and the two triggers are independent of one another, meaning that the enters/leaves the battlefield trigger will trigger and resolve regardless of whether the creature has changed zones.  \n  \nNow if you were to flicker the creature with those two triggers on the stack, the creature would re-enter as a new permanent (whose evoke cost was NOT payed), and the sacrifice trigger would simply fizzle.  \n  \nThis is to say that blinking an Evoke creature does in fact work.",
