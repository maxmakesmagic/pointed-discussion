Granted, much of its strongest removal were the board-clearing kind, but the precedent is there.<br/><br/>That said, <a class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Path to Exile\" href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path to Exile\">Path to Exile</a> is too powerful, it puts nearly everything else to shame with its effect vs cost ratio, and can be used for mana acceleration in a pinch.
