That's worth a solid star.  \n+1/+1 if an opponent has a white permanent? All that does is make it a conditional 4/4 for 5 CMC, which is still bad. This may be written down as a separate ability, but it's still negligible given the mana cost. 0 stars for that.  \n  \nTotal: 1 star  \nHilariously enough, I would go so far as to say this card is rated over twice as high as it should be.",
