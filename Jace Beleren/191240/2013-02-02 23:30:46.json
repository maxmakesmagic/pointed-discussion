Sure, it gives your opponent an extra card, but you also might get something you need. The second ablity is also really good. For only -1, you get to draw an extra card, giving you card advantage. That means you can use the +2 ablity once for every two times you use the -1 ablity. Lastly, we have the ultimate. The ultimate goes off at a hefty -10.
