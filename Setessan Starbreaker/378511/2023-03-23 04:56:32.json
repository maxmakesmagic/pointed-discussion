When you need to destroy an Enchantment (not just an Aura), it's ![3](/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&name=3&type=symbol)![Red](/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&name=R&type=symbol)![White](/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&name=W&type=symbol). If you play the creature first and then wait, the destruction happens at instant speed. It's more colourful, but what it really does is create a threat.  \n  \nYour opponents will be less likely to play big enchantments unless they're willing to reciprocate. That means that you could save yourself a few turns before they play those.   \n  \nI honestly hate this card because it's still a \"kill spell\", but it's so inefficient that I'd rather just draft a creature like Pheres-Band Tromper and let them deal with me rather than the other way around.",

Do you think a 2CMC bear that had such power could be at common or even uncommon? Would you even play anything BUT that bear?\n  \n   \nI'm not saying I like this dude. Like others said it is only aruas, not enchantments, so it MAY not hit. BUT, if it were like War Preist, costed only 2 mana, and killed ANY enchantment, then it would be WAY overpowered for limited.
