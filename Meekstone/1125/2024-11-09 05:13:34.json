I was playing black and I had a [Skittering Horror](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skittering Horror) enchanted with 2 [Unholy Strength](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy Strength)s in play. It had attacked long ago, and had been sitting on my side tapped for the majority of the game. Finally, I was able to attack for the win by placing [Paralyze](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paralyze) on my own creature and then paying the 4 mana during my upkeep to untap it.",
