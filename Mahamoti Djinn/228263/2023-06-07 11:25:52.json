Shrugs off [Serra Angel](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra Angel) and [Sengir Vampire](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir Vampire), kills [Shivan Dragon](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan Dragon) and lives to tell the tale. Great finisher for blue decks - either if you're going the control route with white or combining with green for mana acceleration to get him out earlier (which was my preference - I'd hope to bring him out on turn 3 with [Sol Ring](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol Ring) and [Birds of Paradise](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds of Paradise)). Slap an [Unstable Mutation](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable Mutation) on him and swing away.",
