It's a Timetwister with a balanced casting cost, and exiled after casting to break any chance of combo shenanigans. Time Spiral at least had a really interesting extra effect. They could have made this different by saying \"shuffle all graveyards and cards in play into their owner's library\" or something wacked out like that. It still would have been the same theme, but would have actually added something to the game besides a balanced cost.",
