I think he could be better of course perhaps we could get lucky and get a new version of him soon. As it is though I think he does wonders for some decks. Dredge/Madness/Unearth/Scavenge...just to name a few.<br/><br/>If a deck is very strongly designed as a 1cmc/2cmc build Tibalt becomes Boss.

Put him out on your second turn (and odds are your opponent(s) can't hit him for another turn or so) draw your card, and with most of your cards activating in the graveyard the random card you're sending there is probably cheaper and more useful there then in your hand. You get to pretty much replace the card you want in the grave with something that you may be able to use right then. And if you keep adding cards with effects such as \"deal # amount of damage to # amount of cards\" (for a basic example) then you can keep him protected by picking off anything that might hit him, and if not all of them you can a) kill some but not all, b) weaken a few, or c) kill some and weaken the ones attacking.... <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" onclick=\"ExpandPost(event, this, 305655)\">(see all)</a></span>\n<div class=\"postDetails\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_recentPosts_postsRepeater_ctl00_postDetails\" style=\"padding-top: 5px;\">\n<div class=\"reportAbuse\">\n<a href=\"http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php?p_prods=522,706,739&amp;p_cats=\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_recentPosts_postsRepeater_ctl00_reportAbuseLink\">\r\n                                    Report Abuse</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n                                    \r\n                            </div>\n<div class=\"postedBy\">\r\n                                Posted By: <a class=\"postedByLink\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" id=\"PostedBy95188\">Lwonders</a>\r\n                                (3/24/2013 11:39:14 PM)\r\n                            </div>\n<div class=\"postRating\">\n<div class=\"postRatingLabel\">\r\n                                    Rating:\u00a0\r\n                                </div>\n<div style=\"float: left;\">\n<div class=\"starRating\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_recentPosts_postsRepeater_ctl00_postRating_starRating\"><img alt=\"0.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"1.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"1.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"2.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"2.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"3.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"3.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"4.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"4.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftSolidSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"5.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightSolidSmall.gif\"/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"postRating\">\n<div class=\"postRatingLabel\">\r\n                                    \u00a0\r\n                                </div>\n<div style=\"float: left;\">\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n</div>"
