Dragon Collected with large purses drive the price up and the 2-3 thousand people who have these still in any condition to sell name the price i respectfully end my argument, good day sir</span>\n<div class=\"postDetails\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_recentPosts_postsRepeater_ctl01_postDetails\" style=\"padding-top: 5px;\">\n<div class=\"reportAbuse\">\n<a href=\"http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1208\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_recentPosts_postsRepeater_ctl01_reportAbuseLink\">\r\n                                    Report Abuse</a>\u00a0\u00a0\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\n<div class=\"postedBy\">\r\n                                Posted By: <a class=\"postedByLink\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" id=\"PostedBy1045\">Velish_Mal</a>\r\n                                (8/26/2009 5:26:29 AM)\r\n                            </div>\n<div class=\"postRating\">\n<div class=\"postRatingLabel\">\r\n                                    Rating:\u00a0\r\n                                </div>\n<div style=\"float: left;\">\n<div class=\"starRating\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_recentPosts_postsRepeater_ctl01_postRating_starRating\"><img alt=\"0.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"1.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"1.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"2.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"2.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"3.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"3.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"4.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"4.5\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/LeftClearSmall.gif\"/><img alt=\"5.0\" src=\"../../Images/Stars/RightClearSmall.gif\"/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"postRating\">\n<div class=\"postRatingLabel\">\r\n                                    \u00a0\r\n                                </div>\n<div style=\"float: left;\">\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br class=\"clear\"/>\n</div>"
