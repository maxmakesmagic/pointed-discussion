The kind of card that you wait until the end phase of your opponent's turn before using it, dumping any extra mana you have.  A fun card for tossaround, but not one I'd probably play in a tournament deck.",

You cast Riverfall and enchant it with the Clout, while Clout is on the stack, it's a 3/3.

And, if you cast another spell that's blue and red, it will STILL be a 5/5 because it becoming a 3/3 doesn't add +1/+2, it sets it's power and toughness.<br /><br />So yeah. Just a tidbit for ya'll to ponder. 2/1, 4/3, and 5/5 are your Riverfall/Clout options.

However some straightforward decks that work is a good idea.<br /><br />However we also need decks that work right in draft.  I wasn't thinking about this back then, but our draft format had 2 Shadowmoor packs, and 1 Eventide pack.  The Shadowmoor packs do not have any Red/White cards in them at all.  The Eventide packs have about 1.4833 per pack.  The whole draft opens 8 Eventide packs, for about 11.8667 per draft.  Lets say the draft has 12, including one of these.  You get half of them, including this one.  That means you have 5 other ones in your pool.  In a pretty long game, you might draw 17 cards, say this and about 2 of the 5.  If this 2 mana creature lives the whole game (and it probably doesn't), you would get 2 triggers, which is pretty cool.  However, that is assuming you get a lot of good cards from Eventide; you typically play about 8 cards from each booster set.  Here we are assuming that, before you look at what red or white cards you are playing, you are playing 6 of the Red+White cards.  That will happen some times, but not frequently.<br /><br />This card works great in EEE, but doesn't trigger much in SSE drafts.  That's fine; some cards work that way.  But I think the set has a bit too many cards, especially at common, that work that way.  I would consider changing one of the commons.  Maybe it would be this one; maybe another.  The change could be to make it uncommon, and move a card that works better with Shadowmoor cards down to common.  Another approach would be to give you some reward when you play a Red card, and some reward when you play a White card.  It would still be great in a RW deck, but would work reasonably well in a deck that is 2/3 Shadowmoor cards.<br /><br />Maybe after playing with the cards, we would decide to stick with the current version of the Mimic.  It is hard to know; that is why we play test.  However I would bring up the analysis of why this type of card won't trigger very often.

That lowers my versitility score for that combo, and thats a reason why i wouldnt build a deck with 4 and 4 just to pull it off, unless i built it around it and had no other multi perms. Plus you cant have multiple of those combos at once, because once again the shroud would trigger before the enchant and it backfires on you.

Especially with [autocard]Edric, Spymaster of Trest[/autocard] having such great synergy with the Coatl and the Infiltrator, by the time I get the Fable out (which takes all available mana for one turn), I don't get to cast another creature until the next turn, and the tokens produced still have summoning sickness.\n\nI gave it 4 stars, but that's based more on the idea of the card more than its actual usefulness",

   "text_parsed": "To DragonLord132:<br />Green is not the best competitive color. All colors are equally competitive in their own particular ways. Green just happens to be unbridled power and beats the ever-living-crap out of you. Red, Blue, White, and Black are all a bit more strategic in the way that they win (in fact, I don't know of many Blue decks that actually have a way of winning, they just do). It is for this reason that many people mistake Green as the most powerful color. Sadly, I see Green as being the easiest color and least mentally challenging. That's right, all you mono-Green enthusiasts, exercise your brain a bit and come up with some strategy other than &quot;Ooh, I've got a big trampler now.&quot;<br /><br />As for the card, I do think that this is amazing. I got one of these in a lot and traded him (as my only green deck at the time was a saproling token deck) for a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanguine Bond\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sanguine Bond\">Sanguine Bond</a> for my vamp deck. Good trade? I think so, but I have since been beaten with this card multiple times. Last time I played against my friend's deck with one of these in it, he killed me 5th turn with an 21/21 Primalcrux. A turn after he played Primalcrux, he threw a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mythic Proportions\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mythic Proportions\">Mythic Proportions</a> on it.<br /><br />However, as for the text on this card, I don't ever see Primalcrux being &quot;backed into a corner.&quot;<br /><br />This card gets a 4.5 from me.",
   "text_posted": "To DragonLord132:\nGreen is not the best competitive color. All colors are equally competitive in their own particular ways. Green just happens to be unbridled power and beats the ever-living-crap out of you. Red, Blue, White, and Black are all a bit more strategic in the way that they win (in fact, I don't know of many Blue decks that actually have a way of winning, they just do). It is for this reason that many people mistake Green as the most powerful color. Sadly, I see Green as being the easiest color and least mentally challenging. That's right, all you mono-Green enthusiasts, exercise your brain a bit and come up with some strategy other than \"Ooh, I've got a big trampler now.\"\n\nAs for the card, I do think that this is amazing. I got one of these in a lot and traded him (as my only green deck at the time was a saproling token deck) for a [autocard]Sanguine Bond[/autocard] for my vamp deck. Good trade? I think so, but I have since been beaten with this card multiple times. Last time I played against my friend's deck with one of these in it, he killed me 5th turn with an 21/21 Primalcrux. A turn after he played Primalcrux, he threw a [autocard]Mythic Proportions[/autocard] on it.\n\nHowever, as for the text on this card, I don't ever see Primalcrux being \"backed into a corner.\"\n\nThis card gets a 4.5 from me.",

Next turn, dredge Life back, return 3 cards, and repeat.<br /><br />Discarding your hand generally isn't a problem, because you'll just dredge back Life from the Loam.

If you control a [autocard]Shivan Reef[/autocard], this comes into play untapped and you can add [UU], [UR], or [RR] already, but [autocard]Sulfur Falls[/autocard] would come into play tapped, hindering your 2nd turn play... However, it may be only a corner-case, it depends from what you have in your deck. \n\nI like them so much, third best dual land in Modern, after Ravnica shock-land (first) and Zendikar fetch-land (second, even if they don't form a complete cycle, in Modern)\n\nMy favourite of the cycle, because I love [UR]\n4.5/5",

   "text_parsed": "<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord of the Pit\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lord of the Pit\">Lord of the Pit</a> starts the conversation about Black Chroma/Devotion. Demons are an EXCELLENT resource to mine for Black Mana Symbols, but I also wouldn't want to use too many of them. Very few are truly worth it, but at the same time, a high percentage of 'Black Mana Symbol Creatures' that are worth it, are demons. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reiver Demon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Reiver Demon\">Reiver Demon</a> seems like an outstanding choice, but <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Griselbrand\">Griselbrand</a> feels pretty hardcore and possibly more heat than you want to pack, depending on your format, metagame, #ofplayers, and the hate you could expect to be boarded in against you either next game or next week. <br /><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried Alive\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Buried Alive\">Buried Alive</a> is clearly far more important than <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Entomb\">Entomb</a> in this deck's instance, because the most # Black Symbols Entomb can net is either 3 or 4, but Buried Alive can get 6 without hardly trying. <br /><br />Knights are also a great option. There aren't an overwhelmingly huge # of black Knights, but there are enough to give you a choice of options from. <br /><br />Finally, while it's certainly tempting to look at <i>Shadowmoor</i> and <i>Eventide</i> and cram everything bigger than <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Phyrexian\">Phyrexian</a> Obliterator in, I think the key to the deck being awesome is being VERY deliberate and SPECIFIC in your selection of the 5-mana Symbol slot: <br /><br />Don't use more than 1 or 2 of these: <br /><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod of Revenge\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Demigod of Revenge\">Demigod of Revenge</a>: Works best in highly Aggressive decks, also since you'll be running Buried Alive, running 4 copies is a smart option and you can include any of many single-reanimation cards to get all of them out of your grave. Excellent Plan B for when your Umbra Stalker runs smack dab into Wrath of God, and if you can find an Instant Reanimation effect, probably the ONLY good strategy to escape a simple <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic of Progenitus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Relic of Progenitus\">Relic of Progenitus</a> ruining your whole game plan.<br /><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastlord of Fugue\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ghastlord of Fugue\">Ghastlord of Fugue</a>: Simply put, not a Spike option for your deck. It's got some good elements for Control and Disruption, but I'd include it as a wild card to something unexpected instead of trying to have this be an additional axis of the deck after Umbra Stalker. <br /><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divinity of Pride\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Divinity of Pride\">Divinity of Pride</a>: A Boss Ass ***. The Lifelink is incredibly badass.

   "text_posted": "[autocard]Lord of the Pit[/autocard] starts the conversation about Black Chroma/Devotion. Demons are an EXCELLENT resource to mine for Black Mana Symbols, but I also wouldn't want to use too many of them. Very few are truly worth it, but at the same time, a high percentage of 'Black Mana Symbol Creatures' that are worth it, are demons. [autocard]Reiver Demon[/autocard] seems like an outstanding choice, but [autocard]Griselbrand[/autocard] feels pretty hardcore and possibly more heat than you want to pack, depending on your format, metagame, #ofplayers, and the hate you could expect to be boarded in against you either next game or next week. \n\n[autocard]Buried Alive[/autocard] is clearly far more important than [autocard]Entomb[/autocard] in this deck's instance, because the most # Black Symbols Entomb can net is either 3 or 4, but Buried Alive can get 6 without hardly trying. \n\nKnights are also a great option. There aren't an overwhelmingly huge # of black Knights, but there are enough to give you a choice of options from. \n\nFinally, while it's certainly tempting to look at [i]Shadowmoor[/i] and [i]Eventide[/i] and cram everything bigger than [autocard]Phyrexian[/autocard] Obliterator in, I think the key to the deck being awesome is being VERY deliberate and SPECIFIC in your selection of the 5-mana Symbol slot: \n\nDon't use more than 1 or 2 of these: \n\n[autocard]Demigod of Revenge[/autocard]: Works best in highly Aggressive decks, also since you'll be running Buried Alive, running 4 copies is a smart option and you can include any of many single-reanimation cards to get all of them out of your grave. Excellent Plan B for when your Umbra Stalker runs smack dab into Wrath of God, and if you can find an Instant Reanimation effect, probably the ONLY good strategy to escape a simple [autocard]Relic of Progenitus[/autocard] ruining your whole game plan.\n\n[autocard]Ghastlord of Fugue[/autocard]: Simply put, not a Spike option for your deck. It's got some good elements for Control and Disruption, but I'd include it as a wild card to something unexpected instead of trying to have this be an additional axis of the deck after Umbra Stalker. \n\n[autocard]Divinity of Pride[/autocard]: A Boss Ass Bitch. The Lifelink is incredibly badass. Good for Aggression or Midrange, and I'd probably either 1x or 2x it in every build, next to just one other 5-cost from Eventide.\n\n[autocard]Deity of Scars[/autocard]: Highly unrecommended without [autocard]Gift of the Deity[/autocard], highly recommended with it. Not a lot else to say. More dependent on its \"themed Enchantment\" than the other Avatar-Gods of Eventide. [autocard]Helm of the Ghastlord[/autocard] is also helpful for the Blue one. \n\n\nRecommended Build:\n22 Lands\n4x [autocard]Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx[/autocard]\n4x [autocard]Godless Shrine[/autocard]\n4x [autocard]Marsh Flats[/autocard]\n10x [autocard]Swamp[/autocard]\n22 creatures\n4x [autocard]Umbra Stalker[/autocard]\n4x [autocard]Demigod of Revenge[/autocard]\n2x [autocard]Divinity of Pride[/autocard]\n3x [autocard]Black Knight[/autocard]\n3x [autocard]Stillmoon Cavalier[/autocard]\n1x [autocard]Rakdos the Defiler[/autocard]\n1x [autocard]Obzedat, Ghost Council[/autocard]\n4x [autocard]Reiver Demon[/autocard]\n16 spells\n4x [autocard]Buried Alive[/autocard]\n4x [autocard]Reanimate[/autocard]\n4x [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard]\n4x [autocard]Sign in Blood[/autocard]\n\nThere's no room for Phyrexian Obliterator in this version, and if I'd wanted to go for Broken, I wouldn't have considered anything until first scratching down '4x [autocard]Necropotence[/autocard], 4x [autocard]Griselbrand[/autocard]' I like combining Reanimate with Lifegaining effects, because it's a pretty confident promise of a powerful graveyard combo, but it does give your opponents opportunity to try to punish you for paying too much life before you're ready.

The colors of [autocard]Act of Aggression[/autocard], [autocard]Act of Treason[/autocard], [autocard]Blind with Anger[/autocard], [autocard]Commandeer[/autocard], [autocard]Cytoplast Manipulator[/autocard], [autocard]Dominus of Fealty[/autocard] (in set), [autocard]Grab the Reins[/autocard], [autocard]Overtaker[/autocard], [autocard]Roil Elemental[/autocard], [autocard]Ray of Command[/autocard], [autocard]Skyfire Kirin[/autocard], [autocard]Thalakos Deceiver[/autocard], [autocard]Threaten[/autocard]...\n\nHowever, the best option in this case seems definitely to be [autocard]Dominate[/autocard], perhaps with a little help from [autocard]Djinn Illuminatus[/autocard] or [autocard]Ink-Treader Nephilim[/autocard] in a multiplayer game.\n\nOf course, most of these options would work ideally without [autocard]Hive Mind[/autocard] still in play, but guess what? It is easy enough to bounce it, or sacrifice it, or whatever.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, Avacyn Restored is out, and with [autocard]Arcane Melee[/autocard], which works very well with this card. I was lucky enough to immediately draw one, and now, I can finally use the playset of this card I have in my binder. =D [autocard]Dual Casting[/autocard] is also pretty sweet.",

It combos nicely with cards like where ancients tread too, comes into play does immediate 5, attacks for 7, and if it dies it does another 5 when it renters play and leaves you with a 6/1.  It can also combo with mayael's aria, quillspike, or fate transfer, allowing you to cancel out or move its negative counters to other creatures so it can persist indefinitley.  Horde of notions will play it from the graveyard.  That's about as much as you can ask for at only 5 cmc.",

Green has had lifegain since the dawn of Magic and it fits here.\n\nThe creature types were part of the archetypes chosen for Eventide, but even so, Merfolk and Wizards have no shortage of buffs and effects, though one would be hard pressed to splash green into Merfolk as printed.\n\nOverall though, it's a solid, if a bit underwhelming, part of a good cycle.",
