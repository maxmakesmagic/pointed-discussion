That does not use the stack, on the other hand, even the old version has the tapping of the land as a cost (\"0: Do this to do that\" is the same as \"Do this: do that\") which one should not be able to prevent.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the new oracle wording giving the land this ability totally messes it up. It's not like this was an ultra-powerful card which had to be errata's to be toned down, you know...",

Heartbeat does pretty much the exact same thing, but with any lands, any easier casting cost, and it doesn't keep the lands tapped.<br /><br />Winter's Night DOES have one saving grace that makes it better than Heartbeat; it keeps your opponent tapped out when they tap snow lands. Since neither the Winter's Night and Heartbeat contain the word 'may', every player tapping land must add the mana and, in Winter's Night's case, must keep them tapped.<br /><br />With this in mind a deck could be made around Winter's Night. Use cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcum's Weathervane\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Arcum's Weathervane\">Arcum's Weathervane</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimefeather Owl\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rimefeather Owl\">Rimefeather Owl</a> to make lands snow and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn Muse\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Seedborn Muse\">Seedborn Muse</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rude Awakening\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rude Awakening\">Rude Awakening</a>, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear Umbra\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Bear Umbra\">Bear Umbra</a> to keep your lands always up. You'll be able to benefit from the doubled mana while your opponent will still get double mana, but be drained next turn.<br /><br />An interesting card that can still be useful. It is also reasonable priced at around 1$ while Heartbeat can be a tad more expensive. I give Winter's Night a 3/5<br /><br />~Zuty",

   "text_parsed": "You remember back in school when they taught you tricks to pass the test without learning anything? My favorite one was 'the answer that uses more words is usually right'.  This rule, like every other, is completely terrible to follow unless you know WHY you're doing it, but I posit that BRAINSTORM, using more words and therefore giving you MORE OPTIONS and complexity, is actually BETTER than ANCESTRALL RECALL.\r<br />\r<br />Think about it this way- Ancestrall Recall is good for exactly one thing- putting lots of cards from your library into your hand.  Why would you want to do this? To have more spells to play, or to dig through your library for one spell, or to combine with other cards for a sometimes convoluted, sometimes straightforward huge advantage. Brainstorm actually does 2 of these JUST AS GOOD as Ancestrall Recall, and one of them lots better.\r<br />\r<br />Let's take a painfully obvious example: Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind. You draw a card, you deal a damage.  \r<br />\r<br />Because Brainstorm is worded so awesomely, it does the same amount of damage with Niv-Mizzet as Ancestrall Recall does. (and the same as Lightning Bolt for you Red-Blue enthusiasts, but you already knew that :D ) \r<br />This applies to all other cards worded like Niv-Mizzet 'whenever you draw a card...' IN ADDITION, you get to 'hide' cards from Duress effects, 'hold' cards past #7 without discarding, or any number of things you can think of to do this effect. Heck, putting two back even is a small guard against self-mill. So most of the cards that specifically make drawing cards even better than it already is would probably prefer Brainstorm, because of that Magic wording.\r<br />\r<br />Now let's look at digging: if you're only looking for one specific card, you don't want two extra clogging up your hand. You want the card you're looking for, with no strings attached.\r<br />For this kind of mana bargain, you don't get better digging unless its got the word 'Tutor' at the end of its name. You want to play this even in a deck with with Tutors, both because redundancy is good and because of the extra options this card gives you beyond 'Search your library for a card. Warn target opponent to ready their counterspells. Do nothing else.'\r<br />\r<br />Having more spells to play: you can even choose to keep all 3 of your new cards, and throw back two cards from your starting hand if they aren't to your liking, so you are down 2 bad cards and up 3 good cards, which is just freakin great. The absolute, most pessimistic and ignorant way to look at it is 'just' changing the order you are drawing your cards in (as if that isn't good), plus a cantrip. This way of thinking says that this is drawing you only one card for one mana. At Instant Speed. Its about a 1000x better than a card that literally was only 'U: instant. draw a card.', but even that card would be just swell to have. You are adding cards to your hand for a bottom dollar bargain of mana.\r<br />\r<br />Speaking of bottom dollar price tags, compare this to Ancestrall Recall. You know how many Mint Condition Brainstorms you could get for an Ancestral Recall? lots. A playset of every printing, with enough left over to buy a foil Jace, the Mindsculptor if you felt like it.  Just saying.\r<br />\r<br />To be fair: Ancestrall Recall puts 3 cards into your hand that STAY there. When is this better? \r<br />When you need all 3 of those cards in your hand right now.\r<br />Aren't worried about Duress effects\r<br />Don't have 2 SPARE cards to send to the 'holding zone'\r<br />Have a combo which specifically references # cards in your hand.\r<br />\r<br />Admittedly, the first 3 of these might accurately describe preparing for a Counterspell War, and again, Brainstorm is found mostly in Counterspell War.Protect the Combo.dec.\r<br />\r<br />But as for '#cards in your hand', I don't recall Slifer the Sky Dragon ever being all that great in any game, Magic or otherwise. There's better. (I know he's not MTG, its just the card that symbolizes that kind of ability to me.)\r<br />\r<br />Obviously, Ancestrall Recall would not have such a high pricetag on it for no reason, but mostly I think it's due to being ENORMOUSLY more rare than Brainstorm.  People have called Brainstorm the poor man's Ancestral Recall. I call Ancestral Recall the brute's Brainstorm. No subtlety, no pinache. It's almost Red in terms of how blunt of an instrument it is.  Brainstorm is by far Bluer and, just maybe, better.    ",

Any experienced and knowledgeable control deck player will have at least one or two readily accessible mass creature card sweeps if they don't have minor ones. That's why I feel strongly that if you are going to make a Reanimator deck, you should gear it around crippling the enemy asap with cards like Hellcarver Demon or Nicol Bolas. There are cards like Entomb, Putrid Imp, Raven's Crime, etc. that can drop these and cards like Anger, for example, into your GY early, so, with a little mana acceleration, you can use both hasted GY res and non hasted GY res to devastate your enemy fast.",

Pariah is a fantastic card by itself.  But it works well with artillery- if you need to kill a fairly big creature badly, you can now tap an artillery and 5 damage will hit the creature: the three damage that artillery would do to you is rerouted to the creature with pariah on it.  Add that to the 2 dmg you've dealt to the creature already with an artillery.  Or if you like, take out two separate smaller creatures.  What's nice is that you can still do <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=pariah\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"pariah\">pariah</a> artillery antics while <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=personal sanctuary\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"personal sanctuary\">personal sanctuary</a> is in play- you just do them during the opponent's turn.  <br /><br />The fun starts when you stick pariah on a stuffy doll.  By itself, I think <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=pariah \" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"pariah \">pariah </a>plus <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=stuffy doll\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"stuffy doll\">stuffy doll</a> is a sort of mean and predictable combo and I'm not crazy about it.  But what is fun is when you have that combo out and artiillery cards on the battlefield.  Congratulations, you've now turned your artillery into a 5 dmg per turn threat!  Or deal two dmg to an opponent's creature, three damage to them, and repeat it the next turn.  And you're probably not going to die so long as they can't get rid of stuffy plus pariah...<br /><br />And then there's <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=basilisk collar\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"basilisk collar\">basilisk collar</a>.  An artillery equipped with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=basilisk collar\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"basilisk collar\">basilisk collar</a> destroys a creature and the lifelink negates the damage the artillery deals to you, so you actually gain 2 life every time you use the equipped artillery.  The funny thing is that if absolutely everything goes right in the deck, a basilisk collared artillery can do 5 damage to an opponent  and gain you 5 life every turn.  See how?  <br /><br />I also &quot;splash&quot; black with<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name= city of brass\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\" city of brass\"> city of brass</a> and<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name= vivid crag\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\" vivid crag\"> vivid crag</a>/meadow for<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name= vault of the archangel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\" vault of the archangel\"> vault of the archangel</a>.  Worth it?  Idk.<br /><br />So the deck isn't particularly good, but it <i>is </i>ironic- it turns the downside of a fairly bad line of cards  into an advantage.

   "text_parsed": "This card is an interesting collision of flavor-based mechanics that get in the way of what the card really wants to do. First, it wants to carry a rider by giving it +1/+1 and flying.

The way creatures were priced back then was fairly linear with respect ot power/toughness, whereas today things ramp up in power considerably after 4 CMC to make creatures comparable to spells in power.<br /><br />So if you're a developer in these times of CMC = ~max(P, T). This set will also introduce the largest creature ever, an 11/11 with CMC 11 (with a considerable drawback). You're working on a card with the theme &quot;snow lands make it stronger -- tap one to give it +1/+1&quot;. Which means, effectively, that it's CMC is X, and once it attacks its P/T could be P+X+1/T+X+1.  Now, find a fair X.<br /><br />You can't. If you start of with a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill Giant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Hill Giant\">Hill Giant</a> at 3/3 for CMC 4, you're basically dedicating to have an 8/8 swinging around turn 5. Sooner with moxen, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark Rituals\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dark Rituals\">Dark Rituals</a>, and lotuses, though those will of course make it weaker. The fair thing to do is reduce the gap by reducing the printed P/T, like they did with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain Titan\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mountain Titan\">Mountain Titan</a>... which puts it at about 1/1, and as soon as you tap out any <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuran Spellcaster\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Zuran Spellcaster\">Zuran Spellcaster</a> can kill it. Lame. <br /><br />So now you've figure out linear pricing + drawbacks don't work well. Maybe you could reduce the CMC by making it double-, or even triple-red? (If it only fits in mono-red decks, why not just give it {R}: +1/+1?) Or gold? (We have plenty of gold cards. Make this work as a mediocre-range red card.) So there goes all previous experience to draw on. Not that it's a lot. This is only the 6th expansion, the first large expansion. What do you do? <br /><br />Well, from a practical standpoint a 10/10 and a 12/12 aren't very different from one another.... Boom, CMC 7. Maybe someone will figure out how to cast it. After all, moxen, rituals, lotuses, etc. Yeah, this guy has a shot. And &quot;sucks for defense&quot; is a drawback after all, even if it's not spelled out. It's like a big Ironclaw Orcs. That effectively sucks mana. Right?<br /><br />(Nevermind that the first Sligh deck won't even be invented until after this set and the two sets after this is released. Yes, this card predates both the notions mana curve and of &quot;drawbacks don't matter&quot; aggro by two sets. As I said, this guy never had a shot.)",

Now just cruise into the win condition of your choice (oh and feel free to discard that imp or any other creatures you might have now!)\n\nThis is a fun way to [autocard]Living Death[/autocard], ramp into a giant demon, or other neat ideas. \n\nHonestly I'm not sure why there's not a super-dredge deck relying on this, [autocard]exsanguinate[/autocard] or [autocard]drain life[/autocard], and loads of draw spells. I get that there is a lot of grave hate, but most of that isn't at instant speed, and if you run {G} you can probably nail the grave hate before it would effect you.

As if the machine that puts cards into the packs had a Mana Crypt stuck in it for fifteen years, and that it coincidentally slipped out and into a Zendikar pack that I happened to buy. I felt so extremely excited and ecstatic, I was overpowered by nostalgia and truly, it was, I believe to be the most magnificent moment in my history of playing Magic.

I soon found out that they were doing this on purpose, and I have to say I applaud you guys out there at R&amp;D or whoever decided to put these cards into the new packs. And as a bonus card, nonetheless! I was so excited to get this card because I started playing Magic when I was about eight years old, in 1995, and I had a lots of cards that accumulated over the years. I played until I was about fifteen years old, when I got a girlfriend, and was with her for a good four years. During that time my life was pretty much just HER, and unfortunately, she wasn't much into MTG. So I gave my little brother all my cards that I'd collected over the years and hoped he would gain interest. . . . . Oh I was FURIOUS, when I found out that he had traded all of them for a piece of junk, old, rusty, and seriously crummy skateboard. The kid screwed my brother and of course I was mad! Fast forward to today, I have been trying to reestablish my collection and I don't have very many classic cards. Pulling Mana Crypt was really a very special moment for me, and only boosted my love for Magic even more. Thank you Wizards, and long live MTG!<br />     ",

Oh I was FURIOUS, when I found out that he had traded all of them for a piece of junk, old, rusty, and seriously crummy skateboard. The kid screwed my brother and of course I was mad! Fast forward to today, I have been trying to reestablish my collection and I don't have very many classic cards. Pulling Mana Crypt was really a very special moment for me, and only boosted my love for Magic even more. Thank you Wizards, and long live MTG!\n     ",

   "text_parsed": "<b>Braid_of_Fire's Card of the Day #1</b><br /><br />This is the sort of card that makes the early expansions of Magic so incredible: it has provocative art, a build-around-me effect, and does something very flavorful and exciting.  How does a white general inspire its troops?  It provides a hero for them to all emulate, a lord which empowers them by his or her presence alone.  How do Goblins and Orcs inspire their troops in red?  They kill one, telling everyone else &quot;this will be you if we lose&quot;.  Red is all about emotion, and while that's difficult to capture in a card game, Orc General captures the sentiment that Orcs will fight harder with these emotions running through them.<br /><br />In terms of playability, this card falls flat.  It could absolutely squeeze its way into a non-serious Goblin deck if the tap effect was granted towards Orcs and Goblins or if the general himself was a Goblin, but the early Magic dichotomy between Orcs and Goblins, which are flavorfully almost the same, caused a terrible disconnect between the cards and made all of the Orc cards diminish in value over time as WotC replaced them with Goblins in every set.  Considering Orcs would be more likely to have splashed into black in later sets, and Goblins were a little forced when they did such in Lorwyn, maybe this wasn't the best idea overall, but Goblins absolutely have their fanbase so I'll take it that their market research pulled for our goofy friends the Goblins every time.",
   "text_posted": "[b]Braid_of_Fire's Card of the Day #1[/b]\n\nThis is the sort of card that makes the early expansions of Magic so incredible: it has provocative art, a build-around-me effect, and does something very flavorful and exciting.  How does a white general inspire its troops?  It provides a hero for them to all emulate, a lord which empowers them by his or her presence alone.  How do Goblins and Orcs inspire their troops in red?  They kill one, telling everyone else \"this will be you if we lose\".  Red is all about emotion, and while that's difficult to capture in a card game, Orc General captures the sentiment that Orcs will fight harder with these emotions running through them.\n\nIn terms of playability, this card falls flat.  It could absolutely squeeze its way into a non-serious Goblin deck if the tap effect was granted towards Orcs and Goblins or if the general himself was a Goblin, but the early Magic dichotomy between Orcs and Goblins, which are flavorfully almost the same, caused a terrible disconnect between the cards and made all of the Orc cards diminish in value over time as WotC replaced them with Goblins in every set.
