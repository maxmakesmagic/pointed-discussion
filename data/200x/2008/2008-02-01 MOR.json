Rather it gives you the option to tap 3 elves, meaning summoning sickness rules don't apply.  So, for example, if you have many elves that all cost only 1 mana or are reduced in mana cost by a banneret creature, you can basically empty your hand into play the minute you play her.  First turn, llanowar elf, second turn elvish visionary, third turn heritage druid, use extra 4 mana from two mana producing creatures and lands to cast more elves, tap all elves to cast further elves, which also tap, and cast the rest of the elves you have.  Once saw someone drop 10 elves on turn 4 with it.  These rules also hold true for merfolk decks, they don't actually have to tap such as when they are attacking, they can tap anytime; and enchantments that say merfolk on them count as merfolk, this is also true of elves so you can tap an elf type enchantment for heritage druid.  Why wotc made it this way I have no idea, since its pretty outrageous, but it does allow you to do some insanely crazy elf deck shinnenigans.  Just beware your opponent doesn't have firespout, volcanic fall out, lavalanche, or jund charm, because emptying your whole hand full of elves to have them burned away is not fun.",

The best thing about this card that really stands out is that it says when it \"leaves play\" not when it goes to graveyard, the ability works even if the creature is exiled or temporarily removed from play with spells like ghostway and otherworldly journey.  You could play spitebellows, wait for an opponent to try to kill it or chump block it, then remove it with otherworldly journey, do 6 to a creature, and have it come back into play as an 8/3.  Can also evoke infinite number of times with a paleoloth in play, since evoking it still plays the creature who is 6 power, allowing you to return a 5+ power creature from your graveyard.  Pair that with a stuffy doll and six mana gives you 12 damage a turn to target opponent, though it would require a lot of set up to play stuffy doll, paleoloth, and a spite bellows together.",

Two, it totally goes along with the idea of kithkin swarm, put out alot of kithkins that get pumped/whatever for every other kithkin. Finally, the real icing on the cake is that this card is a countermeasure to the only kind of card that can stop an early game aggro soldiers - destroy all creatures. HAHAHA! WRATH EFFECTS BE DAMNED! Having this kind of abillity on a white card makes me feel like I'm playing black zombies somehow. Case and point, Kithkins are one Butt-kickin' tribal synergy. I prefer them over human soldiers anyday - BEWARE THE ALMIGHTY THOUGHTWEFT!",

Include some [autocard]Elvish Archdruid[/autocard]s to pump your weenie druids for some cursory defenses, then maim face with [autocard]Howl of the Night Pack[/autocard], [autocard]Jolrael, Empress of Beasts[/autocard], or, my personal favorite, [autocard]Overrun[/autocard] with masses of elves.",
