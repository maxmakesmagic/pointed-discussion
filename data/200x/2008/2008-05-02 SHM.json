Trading this creature to not take damage and/or scar a fatass.  And are people expecting 6 toughness? That is a little too good.

Green creatures tend to be territorial and not really on the lookout for more lands.

Since the Acid-Moss lets you search for any forest (including nonbasic) but puts it into play tapped, theres nothing better to find with it than this, which comes into play tapped already. Sure, 1 life per activation isn't much, but it can make a difference sometimes. This card gets a solid 3.5/5 from me.",

This is because deathtouch is a state-based action that occurs when a creature deals damage to another creature.  Deathtouch triggers during the combat damage step of the combat phase, and the next time the game's state-based actions check occurs is not until the end of the combat damage step (this is different than pre-M10 rules).  Thus the lethal damage from a creature with power greater than 1 and the deathtouch apply to the creature and resolve as state-based actions at the same time and are treated as a single destruction event, that only a single regenerating shield is needed to replace, and only a single cost of {1}{B} is needed to activate on Cinderbones.<br /><br />Edit: The following day after I originally wrote this article, Aaron Forsythe mentioned in an article on Daily MTG that the rules for Deathtouch are being rewritten (and slightly changed) for M11. In addition to other functional changes, the FAQ will be updated to reflect the issue of regeneration.  See http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/97<br /><br />Regardless, I agree that 3 mana is too much for a 1/1, even one with deathtouch and wither.  As a common, the cost is adequate: {B} for a black 1/1 creature, {B} for deathtouch, {1} for wither. Still, I would prefer it with only {B} for the regenerate cost or a 2/2 at the cost of 3 CMC.",

Convert that BB to WW, and then tap this guy for WWW, then untap,  left with W, bring forth the thrull, bam, infinite mana, and then infinite revive creatures from GYs. Well, it sounds nice and all, but it IS a 5 card combo.

And, it could still work if you used Ashnod's Altar... maybe. Anyway, if this comboing isn't your thing, you should know, it's my thing and I don't care about what you think of it.

Of course, if you're wondering how they're infinite.... [autocard]Paradise Mantle[/autocard] and [autocard]Training Grounds[/autocard]. You don't even need to splash blue. You'll have a Paradise mantle, just tap that for blue, play training grounds, and then you're set. It's infinite combos for beginners, practically. Anyway, I'm sure you can come up with something for this guy, and if you can't, I'll give you a little push. [autocard]Ashnod's Altar[/autocard]. Such an amazing card, and a combo piece. Here's another one, [autocard]Farrelite Priest[/autocard], and, believe it or not, [autocard]Blood Vassal[/autocard].\n\n2 plains, a paradise mantled this, a training grounds, and both the priest and the vassal in the GY\nTap a plains, tap this guy, that's WW, untap, bring the Priest. Tap, tap your other plains, then untap, bring in the Vassal. Sac the vassal, adding BB to your mana pool. Convert that BB to WW, and then tap this guy for WWW, then untap,  left with W, bring forth the thrull, bam, infinite mana, and then infinite revive creatures from GYs. Well, it sounds nice and all, but it IS a 5 card combo. You could substitute Blood Vassal for [autocard]Blood Pet[/autocard], and it'd still work. And, it could still work if you used Ashnod's Altar... maybe. Anyway, if this comboing isn't your thing, you should know, it's my thing and I don't care about what you think of it. I like it so I'm stickin with it. Thinking about it, it's actually a three card combo. [autocard]Enlightened tutor[/autocard] can grab the mantle/training grounds, and the other cards just need to be sent to the GY by some card.",

No, not the <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swerve\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Swerve\">Swerve</a>-like spell (though they work too), but the tactic. Draw out the counterspells by playing something flashy- a Jace, a Wolly Thoctar, or some other mid-range yet threatening spell. Then your real threats can pull through- the big Martial Coups, and so on. There can only be so many counterspells. \r<br />-Outlast. Blue is shortchanged in a lot of areas. It can't deal with threats in a lasting way. It can bounce, but you can replay. It can steal creatures, but there are always ways to get them back. It's creatures are outmatched by most other colours, it's clock is slow. If you get a few threats to stick, there is very little mono-blue can do.\r<br />-Speed. There's a reason control only made a comeback when Rise of the Eldrazi slowed the game down, and even then it needed White alongside the blue to deal with creatures. But since we're talking about the pwoer of counterspells alone, almost any modern deck can kill a blue mage before he or she locks the game down.

He does not only make the sentence almost unreadable that way - concerning the content 95% of his comments only rant about the art and how great and/or bad the card is, sometimes also parroting precedent comments.\nIf you're lucky, he just simply copy-pastes the flavour text, which legible, but not more useful either.\nHe doesn't even troll yet manages to post some of the most useless comments here on Gatherer.\nSearch for them by checking his name and you'll see...\nIf you're reading this MasterOfEtherium, no offense, but please for the sake of it: post something useful, or post nothing at all.",

The untap costs of the Q creatures all involve mana payments, preventing them from “going infinite” with these Auras (or with any of the many previous cards that grant “<img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=tap&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Tap\" align=\"absbottom\" />” abilities.)\r<br />\r<br />The other interesting thing about Elemental Mastery is that it has what developer Noah Weil called the “<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waylay\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Waylay\">Waylay</a> problem” after the <i>Urza’s Saga </i>card that originally brought to light the problem with the “at end of turn” template. The trick to using cards like these is that if you cast/activate them after the end step has begun, the delayed trigger won’t happen until the beginning of the next end step on the following turn. So, under its printed wording, you could cast <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waylay\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Waylay\">Waylay</a> in your opponent’s end step, untap with the Knights, attack, and then exile them at the beginning of your end step. Distasteful errata handles that card, but you can do the same trick with Elemental Mastery by making a batch of tokens in your opponent’s end step, untapping, then making a second batch on your turn, essentially allowing you to attack with twice as many as the card seems to intend.\r<br />\r<br />There are people in R&amp;D that would rather we stop making cards that work like this altogether. I took a different approach, changing the “at end of turn” template to “at the beginning of the next end step,” which ideally makes it clear to players that things can happen during the end step after those effects trigger/resolve, hoping to clarify the weird interation as opposed to quashing it. It’s hard to tell for sure if that change has made these interactions easier to understand (if you have any anecdotal evidence, I’d love to hear it), and it may still be true that we should avoid cards like these completely.\r<br />\r<br />But then again, I don’t want us to talk ourselves out of cool stuff if we don’t need to.",

The trick to using cards like these is that if you cast/activate them after the end step has begun, the delayed trigger won’t happen until the beginning of the next end step on the following turn. So, under its printed wording, you could cast [autocard]Waylay[/autocard] in your opponent’s end step, untap with the Knights, attack, and then exile them at the beginning of your end step. Distasteful errata handles that card, but you can do the same trick with Elemental Mastery by making a batch of tokens in your opponent’s end step, untapping, then making a second batch on your turn, essentially allowing you to attack with twice as many as the card seems to intend.\r\n\r\nThere are people in R&D that would rather we stop making cards that work like this altogether. I took a different approach, changing the “at end of turn” template to “at the beginning of the next end step,” which ideally makes it clear to players that things can happen during the end step after those effects trigger/resolve, hoping to clarify the weird interation as opposed to quashing it. It’s hard to tell for sure if that change has made these interactions easier to understand (if you have any anecdotal evidence, I’d love to hear it), and it may still be true that we should avoid cards like these completely.\r\n\r\nBut then again, I don’t want us to talk ourselves out of cool stuff if we don’t need to.",

If you have additional Eldrazi (big ones, drones, or even spawn) this combo spews out even more Eldrazi Spawn, or might even outright kill them.\n\nNext combat phase your opponent will have to deal with a 20/19 trampling doublestriking token-generator and 15 15/16 doublestriking tokens.  They better have a [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard] because it's going to hurt.",

You can't get draws out of combat damage and cheat him into play at the same time.. While Kaalia does like refilling her hand, this is not the dragon you're looking for.",

This does not offer any combo potential with [autocard]Zur, the Enchanter[/autocard] because it has no effect on cards in libraries. It also doesn't interact with [autocard]Presence of the Master[/autocard] because it doesn't turn spells on the stack into enchantment spells. \"Permanents\" exist only on the battlefield.",

Pro, you can use all 5 colored mana, meaning that if you are playing cards that rely on the amount of specific mana or land you have its very useful ie seismic strike.  Con, it requires green mana to start with, or at least someway of producing green mana, if you have special lands that produce 2 mana for example, or multiple mana like serra's sanctum, then if you are using it to tap for 1 color it loses those abilities as replacement, and lastly if your opponent has a card like.. say boil (destroys all islands) then it kills all your lands.  Still one of the best mana fixers.",

Of course, when you add it all up, it requires a total mana investment of...\n[5]+[2]+[4][U]+[3][U]+([G] or [2])*+[3]+[3]+[3]\nA grand total of either (23)+[U][U] or (21)+[U][U][G]\nA steep price for nigh-omnipotence.\n\n[i]*For either a mana Myr, or [autocard]Llanowar elves[/autocard].[/i]",

Kill it with like a [autocard]lightning bolt[/autocard] or [autocard]arms dealer[/autocard] or sacrifice it to [autocard]High Market[/autocard] or something and do it all over again.  Very solid card, it has a lot more depth then just [autocard]Overrun[/autocard] or [autocard]Emrakul, the Aeons Torn[/autocard] that scream \"WIN\".  Though that is the optimal mode for this guy.  Good dude in edh for sure\n\n5/5",

   "text_parsed": "@Channel Blaze<br /><br />To be fair, some cards have to be improved for people to consider them decent. Shock is way newer than Lightning Bolt, both are common rarity, and there are plenty of strictly better cards than shock. I believe Burst Lightning is the same way (2 damage that can instead be 4.) Why does shock exist? Because there is a need for other cards in some decks to deal 2 damage. Maybe you want Shock Lightning Bolt Galvanic Blast Burst Lightning etc all maindeck.. for some reason. Point is, that's not power creep, it's just bad card design. <br /><br />Terra stomper IS better than nearly everything green has to offer in a vaccuum, however in green blue you could easily throw your Force of Nature to the opponent, tap it or toss it back into your hand, and use it as a backwards unblockable way to deal 8 damage to an opponent. Creativity in Magic is the ability to utilize a downside for a significant upside, and i'd say near unblockable 8 damage to an opponent would be worth the effort, especially with the option to use it as a beater.<br /><br />Sometimes cards just suck. Shatter is one of those. This card is strictly worse than some cards, such as Lightning Bolt, unless your opponent has artifacts. There are better Naturalize, there are many 1 cost destroy artifacts (oxidize, crumble, etc) and many many goblins do it efficiently. <br /><br /><br />Lastly and most importantly, cards are not developed for outside the block (for the most part.) Sometimes the extra damage is needed to balance the card with the block, other times it's needed to be more plain so you can keep internal balance from succumbing as easily to a few OP cards. For the most part there are still internal balance issues, but when you look at some of the early blocks and choice cards from sets, they line up pretty good with choice cards from later sets. <br /><br />Let's go back to Terra Stomper, there are LOADS of terrible-but-large green beatsticks, the fact is, other <i>good</i> ones are in the same power level as Terra stomper. Look at Roar of the Worm. 4 Mana Flashback for a 6/6? That's awesome! Anything that discards it saves you 3 mana, or you can pay 7 for your first, and 4 for your second. Point is, it's an awesome cards that's way old. 6/6 for 4 beats out many of the slower combos you'll be able to name. Name a faster combo like the Progenitus ones, Dreadnought combos, or hypergenesis or whatever and you're merely disproving your own point. The game's powercreep is surprisingly exaggerated. While some things are blatently better, they remain tolerable or nigh inexistent in extended+, and in the current blocks are fine by competing with similar level cards. <br /><br />Usually there are neat benefits to worse Terra Stompers, such as Krosan tusker's awesome cycling+fetchland. He's a terrible creature for the mana cost, but at the same time, he's an awesome card.",
   "text_posted": "@Channel Blaze\n\nTo be fair, some cards have to be improved for people to consider them decent. Shock is way newer than Lightning Bolt, both are common rarity, and there are plenty of strictly better cards than shock. I believe Burst Lightning is the same way (2 damage that can instead be 4.) Why does shock exist? Because there is a need for other cards in some decks to deal 2 damage. Maybe you want Shock Lightning Bolt Galvanic Blast Burst Lightning etc all maindeck.. for some reason. Point is, that's not power creep, it's just bad card design. \n\nTerra stomper IS better than nearly everything green has to offer in a vaccuum, however in green blue you could easily throw your Force of Nature to the opponent, tap it or toss it back into your hand, and use it as a backwards unblockable way to deal 8 damage to an opponent. Creativity in Magic is the ability to utilize a downside for a significant upside, and i'd say near unblockable 8 damage to an opponent would be worth the effort, especially with the option to use it as a beater.\n\nSometimes cards just suck. Shatter is one of those. This card is strictly worse than some cards, such as Lightning Bolt, unless your opponent has artifacts. There are better Naturalize, there are many 1 cost destroy artifacts (oxidize, crumble, etc) and many many goblins do it efficiently. \n\n\nLastly and most importantly, cards are not developed for outside the block (for the most part.) Sometimes the extra damage is needed to balance the card with the block, other times it's needed to be more plain so you can keep internal balance from succumbing as easily to a few OP cards. For the most part there are still internal balance issues, but when you look at some of the early blocks and choice cards from sets, they line up pretty good with choice cards from later sets. \n\nLet's go back to Terra Stomper, there are LOADS of terrible-but-large green beatsticks, the fact is, other [i]good[/i] ones are in the same power level as Terra stomper. Look at Roar of the Worm. 4 Mana Flashback for a 6/6? That's awesome! Anything that discards it saves you 3 mana, or you can pay 7 for your first, and 4 for your second. Point is, it's an awesome cards that's way old. 6/6 for 4 beats out many of the slower combos you'll be able to name.

While some things are blatently better, they remain tolerable or nigh inexistent in extended+, and in the current blocks are fine by competing with similar level cards. \n\nUsually there are neat benefits to worse Terra Stompers, such as Krosan tusker's awesome cycling+fetchland.

[autocard]Dimir Doppelganger[/autocard] has the same versatility as Animate Dead, is repeatable like this card, and dodges negative etb triggers (so does this guy, but the creature still has to enter the battlefield normally first) [i]and[/i] doubles as denial against graveyard strategies.  [autocard]Evil Twin[/autocard] guarantees me a copy without needing to find a way to kill the desired creature when I've got an extra mana open, and even comes with its own kill spell!  And [autocard]Lazav, Dimir Mastermind[/autocard] is just... wow.\n\nThat said, I can see why this guy's good.  The hybrid mana makes him easier to cast than any of the \"better\" cards I listed above.  And with his ability only costing [1], he's a great insurance policy for your own creatures.  You killed my bomb?  That's fine, [i]I've got a spare.[/i]\n\nAnd hey, the fact that it's outclassed by newer cards (and a broken card from Alpha) doesn't make it any less cool.  4/5",

This on [autocard]Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind[/autocard] is an infinite combo already assuming you have more cards in library than your opponent's life total. Mind over Matter is another infinite combo with Niv-Mizzet which doesn't involve you drawing tons of cards. you don't need both at once.\n\nMy favorite target is probably [autocard]Nekusar, the Mindrazer[/autocard] though. \"Whenever an opponent draws a card they discard a card and you draw a card?\" Seems fine. Especially when you have a [autocard]Liliana's Caress[/autocard] out.\n\nThat being said, 4-cost enchantments that don't have some way to protect themselves are often sad. However, if you manage to trigger it once, you're out of the woods card-advantage wise, which makes this better than some of the other dual-color auras from this block.",

So, you'd put it on a little guy, then, and watch him splatter over your bruisers? Problem is, most little guys worth the removal are annoying utility creatures who can tap or activate anyway. Even if they don't have tap abilities, usually they have some activated or triggered that they can get off before they run to their death, which is more than you can say for most removal spells.

Since this has a minimal, delayed effect, it's useless if you're in a jam, unlike a number of other, similarly costed spells.\r<br />3. It's a very conditional removal. You have to have creatures. They have to be bigger than your opponents. The creature has to, generally, be devoid of tapping abilities or defender. It has to be something you CAN block. Etcetera, etcetera.

Your opponent got mostly creatures with fear, shadow, trample, or any other kind of evasion? They all make this card instantly useless.

Or if your opponent doesn't rely on creatures at all, like if he runs a combo, mill, or burn deck.<br /><br />- 3: even IF you play a deck that wins by gaining life (like by using well of lost dreams, searing <br />meditation, test of endurance etc), there are better lifegain cards, because you can't rely on this one.<br /><br />- 4: it doesn't deal with the creature it blocked. Let's assume your opponent ain't an idiot: then his creature is probably capable of killing you, or beeing part of a combo. Which means you want it dead. You don't want it to give your moth a stern look, which is enough to kill it, and then continue beating the crap out of you. You want that creature dead, or you want your opponent dead.

Then the creature keeps attacking you each turn, because instead of adding cards that kill creatures, you added moths. If you'd have killed the creature with condemn or swords to plowshares, you'd have practically gained 5 life the turn you got rid of that creature (since it couldnt hit you) and 5 life any following turn that the creature would attack you, if you wouldn't have been able to take it out.<br /><br />- 6: your opponent knows what's coming. If you play something like condemn or stp, it's at instant speed. Your opponent attacks, maybe just paid for equipment or auras for his creature, and BAM it's gone.
