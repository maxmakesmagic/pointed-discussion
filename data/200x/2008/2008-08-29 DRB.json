   "text_posted": "I do like the idea behind storm... especially within red.\nRed should be about endless mana, cards and opportunities. What I didn't like was the fact how the finishing card was designed. For a cmc9 card, you could expect an auto-win or a near auto-win, but why do I need dragons? THIS is why I don't like the card... and the combination with damage-dealing dragons should have been obvious. \n\nThey could have used [autocard]Ball Lightning[/autocard]-like tokens or an apokalyptic destruction instead to make me happier.\n\nAs for red, storm is why I believe that cards like [autocard]Recycle[/autocard] or [autocard]Future Sight[/autocard] should be red and replace the stupid [autocard]Furnace of Rath[/autocard]-like cards. It's much cooler to win by being able to cast/copy many [autocard]Lightning Bolt[/autocard]s within a single turn than having the damage doubled. So even the [autocard]Mind's Desire[/autocard] would have been much better as a red spell.",

Hell it can be earlier with spells like [autocard]Summoning Trap[/autocard], [autocard]Elvish Piper[/autocard], [autocard]Quicksilver Amulet[/autocard], etc.  It only costs three to keep him alive.\n\n3.  His ability doesn't require combat damage.  It triggers off any damage at all.  So, if say, you were to equip him with [autocard]Shuriken[/autocard]/[autocard]Viridian Longbow[/autocard], or enchant him with [autocard]Hermetic Study[/autocard]/[autocard]Psionic Gift[/autocard], or any number of other things.\n\nFurthermore...\n\n4.  His ability pulls the opponents entire hand.  Not one or two, or four, or {X} cards, but all of them.  You can cast any number of spells that are in his colors to force your opponents to draw cards, sneak some damage at them, and toss them all in the graveyard.\n\nHe is the most powerful of the Elder Dragon Legends by far, and the only one that anyone seriously considers playing.  That's why he was the only one reprinted in this From the Vault series.",

Of course Warstorm Surge wouldn't cause Rith's ability to activate (since it's not combat damage), but one hit with Rith and you summon Saprolings.  Each one of those gets a +1/+1 for each other Saproling you summon.  Then, each Saproling would do damage equal to their power to target creature or player.  <br /><br />For example, hit your opponent with Rith and choose green.  If there are 10 green permanents on the field, you get 10 saprolings.  Each one of those would enter the field as an 11 due to coat of arms.

   "text_posted": "Am I the only one that's thought of using Rith in combination with Warstorm Surge and Coat of Arms?  Of course Warstorm Surge wouldn't cause Rith's ability to activate (since it's not combat damage), but one hit with Rith and you summon Saprolings.  Each one of those gets a +1/+1 for each other Saproling you summon.

I reckon to best make use of this card in any deck, forget attacking and maintaining the token generation, use your tokens to some mass stack CIP effect.
