And she <i>is</i> very nice.<br /><br />Before O-Bolas got his new card, she had the only ability that could increase her loyalty and hold down other 'walkers from attaining an ultimate out of the first generation 'walkers (barring some baby makings by Garruk).<br /><br />Her second ability is only <i><u>really </u></i>good because of her nice beefy beginning loyalty. Most creatures will die from 4 or less damage . . . and her starting loyalty allows her to be a 5cc 6 damage burn spell at any creature. This is really good . . . but after one activation of it, it hurts her far too much to allow her not to die the very next turn more often than not.<br /><br />Her last ability... is a little overkill... 10 damage, to each creature, and their god-'walker (the player, for you nonVorthos)!? By the time that happens, in most red decks, your opponent <i><u><b>will </b></u></i>be dead.<br /><br />A killer beginning this new card type, and a wonderful successor to Jaya. And like <i>most </i>'walker's abilities . . . her &quot;build-up&quot; ability and her &quot;ultimate&quot; ability have awesome synergy with each other.

Chandra's last ability kills, literally. it will completely destroy opponent planeswalkers, and leave their whole feild bare. then you can unleash your full power against your opponent and destroy them. If you can't win after using chandra's last ability, either your opponent has a ton of life, or your doing something way wrong. Super good in any red deck, just make sure to use her last ability at least once if u get her out.",

You can slide Counterspells into almost any blue deck and it gets better.  You don't need to think about whether to use a different counterspell or not- there are none better. That's because Counterspell has hog-tied the developers in their counterspell creation- now players think it if it costs 3, it's too expensive, and if it costs 2 but has a condition (like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove Soul\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Remove Soul\">Remove Soul</a>) it is obviously worse. <br /><br />As for the &quot;it's not fun&quot; argument, I'm not saying we should get rid of all counterspells. I also like the weighing of options, feeding counters, thinks like that. But I am arguing that this particular one, Counterspell, is too powerful. I think two mana is too cheap for this ability. 3 is better, or 1-2 mana with a condition- this will ultimately lead to more varied and interesting counterspells, and more varied play. ",
