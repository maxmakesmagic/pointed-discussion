   "text_parsed": "The &quot;what creature is that in the art&quot; debate has been raging on for several posts and the answer has not been found as of this post. It's obviously a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful Firebrand\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vengeful Firebrand\">Vengeful Firebrand</a>, which was released long after Lorwyn, so I can understand the confusion. The two swords and sheathes match, as well as the scale-mail bracers and overall female flamekin body. I love cards that involve art of other cards or from the main story!<br /><br />Anyway, IMHO, O-ring is the best white removal available. For <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> O-Ring gets rid of not just creatures, but also Planeswalkers, artifacts, other enchantments (including other O-rings!) which is very hard to do with other spells, especially in other colors, without a major drawback. Its cost often messes up your tempo if played early, but if you absolutely have to get rid of something immediately (<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wellwisher\">Wellwisher</a> anyone?) it's well worth it. And, of course, you can always hold it and wait to play it at just the right moment, such as removing that last blocker for the win attack or sending that huge creature your opponent just played to oblivion.<br /><br />The major disadvantage is that it remains on the battlefield and can get bounced or burned itself, and will trigger any enter-the-battlefield abilities of both the card removed, and other cards already on the battlefield. Also, it's an enchantment, so it can only be cast during your turn, and can't be used in combat or in response to something an opponent does.<br /><br />I find the versatility of this card overrides any drawbacks. You have to assume your opponent can get rid of it, or even cares to. It also will remove and enchantments or counters on the creature, and the creature can't regenerate to save itself either. Nobody will want to burn an O-ring to recover their removed <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga Warcaller\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Joraga Warcaller\">Joraga Warcaller</a> after the counters are lost, so the creature is as good as dead. Any other similar counter-oriented card will suffer from the O-ring (such as modular/sunburst creatures) Also, any equipment will have to be re-equipped. The tempo loss from that alone plus the enchantment burn will surely mess up your opponent. <br /><br />Cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path to Exile\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Path to Exile\">Path to Exile</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords to Plowshares\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Swords to Plowshares\">Swords to Plowshares</a> are great 1-drop white removals, but come with drawbacks. Path mana accelerates and land filters your opponent (unless in the rare case that you're landlocked and use it on yourself), which I find to be a significant drawback because now you opponent has an extra land of his color-choice that he didn't draw and is ahead of you mana wise. STP is good if you blast a relatively weak creature (with a special ability or something) but bad if its a fatty because then your opponent gets a lot of life. And, of course, you can blast your own creature if you absolutely need the life. <br /><br />And then there is <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey to Nowhere\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Journey to Nowhere\">Journey to Nowhere</a>, which is <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" /> less to cast but only targets creatures. Also a very good white removal.<br /><br />There are plenty of multicolored removal spells, such as the famous <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vindicate\">Vindicate</a>, which compete for mono-colored removal in a multicolored deck, but that would be a whole different story now. <br /><br />White removal is abundant in the metagame, but I think that O-ring is one of the best. I typically run 4 in every white deck I build unless I can find an appropriate multicolored spell to fit the deck.<br /><br />I also like the Lorwyn art better than the newer version, It just seems more like a &quot;Oh noes! Ive been sent to oblivion!&quot; picture.",
   "text_posted": "The \"what creature is that in the art\" debate has been raging on for several posts and the answer has not been found as of this post. It's obviously a [autocard]Vengeful Firebrand[/autocard], which was released long after Lorwyn, so I can understand the confusion. The two swords and sheathes match, as well as the scale-mail bracers and overall female flamekin body. I love cards that involve art of other cards or from the main story!\n\nAnyway, IMHO, O-ring is the best white removal available. For [2][W] O-Ring gets rid of not just creatures, but also Planeswalkers, artifacts, other enchantments (including other O-rings!) which is very hard to do with other spells, especially in other colors, without a major drawback. Its cost often messes up your tempo if played early, but if you absolutely have to get rid of something immediately ([autocard]Wellwisher[/autocard] anyone?) it's well worth it.

Number three, your mana options will be continually targeted by many decks in the format, which makes each source of varied mana critical in many decks. Every competitive control deck incorporates land control elements (such as Wasteland, Life from the Loam, Sinkhole, and Knight of the Reliquary) that make any type of mana acceleration beyond the cost of 1 completely untenable in any type of deck. And the only decks that can actually viably run mana acceleration in any significant amount are storm decks, which in themselves are hugely risky and vulnerable because they can be brought down by a single spell, like Silence, Force of Will, or Spell Pierce, for example. Number four, as opposed to Paradise Mantle, you can pay for this card in turns before you have to actually use it, as it doesn't require the creature be in play before this can be put into play and be ready for use, which can and will make the difference whether you'll be able to get your key card piece into play.",

And the only decks that can actually viably run mana acceleration in any significant amount are storm decks, which in themselves are hugely risky and vulnerable because they can be brought down by a single spell, like Silence, Force of Will, or Spell Pierce, for example. Number four, as opposed to Paradise Mantle, you can pay for this card in turns before you have to actually use it, as it doesn't require the creature be in play before this can be put into play and be ready for use, which can and will make the difference whether you'll be able to get your key card piece into play.",

It's a little unfortunate that pretty much every tribe save Giants and Treefolk stole their thunder (though they fought back with very splashable Evokers), but it's certainly a big enough staple in other sets to deserve a lord (casual fans rejoyce!). I also like the fun things he can get up to by essentially giving all your elementals Flash (the cost reduction is the boring-yet-practical part to me). We've got enough comes-into-play effects and leaves-play-effects to make your elementals play like instants that can also block some creatures or attack while they're at it.

Every time I play him he's either path'ed, doom bladed, bolted, or some other way removed before I can get full use of his ability. \"\r\n\r\nHere is a card.\r\n\r\n1RR\r\nCreature- Elemental Beast\r\nTrample\r\n20/3\r\n\r\nWhen I play it, it gets killed before I can get in any attacks in with it. I mean, pretty much anything can take it out- Bolt, Path, Doom Blade. It's the biggest target ever. It is therefore useless. \r\n\r\nAs for our soulstroke here, I have to say that I really liked the elementals in Lorwyn. It's a little unfortunate that pretty much every tribe save Giants and Treefolk stole their thunder (though they fought back with very splashable Evokers), but it's certainly a big enough staple in other sets to deserve a lord (casual fans rejoyce!). I also like the fun things he can get up to by essentially giving all your elementals Flash (the cost reduction is the boring-yet-practical part to me). We've got enough comes-into-play effects and leaves-play-effects to make your elementals play like instants that can also block some creatures or attack while they're at it. With such a diverse group to pick through, this ability unites them surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nNot bad at all.",

It's defintley a huge reveillark target.\r\n\r\nIt's best against green and even its own color blue, where removals are less and where creatures matter more (green because green is all about big creatures, and blue because its so anti creature its got to have at least something in play to win).  Any other color is perfectly happy to blast it rather than let you steal their creature.\r\n\r\nAlso fun with teferi, play as an instant and steal a creature during a combat phase to make them block their own attackers.",

You can even use your own burn spells on yourself to regain life in a crisis, lightning helix can regain you 6 life for 2 mana a pop.  Secondly, its great for an aggro deck, it can still attack at 6/6, but its real value is that your opponent now -has- to go through your creatures, and if you circulate around having creature advantage such as in red or green, you just cinched the game.",

   "text_parsed": "There are several good ways to use this creature, if for no other reason than he's only 4 mana for a lifelink creature, but that second ability is very interesting.  Yes you have to sacrifice a creature, but you could use token, or you could use dominus of fealty or sarkahn vol to take your opponents creatures to whack them with.  Primarily what makes the ability so attractive is actually the amount of combat tricks you can play with it.  Imagine you sneak a token past your opponents defenses, play a colossal might on it to do 5, then sacrifice it to do another 5, for a total of 10.  You could also put a devour creature into play, devour everything else for a huge creature, then throw it at your opponent for an immediate game finisher.  If one of your creatures has first strike, it can also do damage, then be sacrificed to do all its damage a second time.  Admittedly your not going to want to sacrifice creatures left and right unless you have a steady supply of tokens, but if your creature is about to die anyways, or be removed by a spell, then may as well get some more damage in.  Can also save your creatures from exiling, if its about to be exiled you can sacrifice it to do damage, and then at least you can revive it later.  A synergistic devour combo might be goblin assault enchantment, then voracious dragon which deals damage based on the amount of goblins it eats when it comes into play, then sacrifice it with brion to do some major damage.",
   "text_posted": "There are several good ways to use this creature, if for no other reason than he's only 4 mana for a lifelink creature, but that second ability is very interesting.  Yes you have to sacrifice a creature, but you could use token, or you could use dominus of fealty or sarkahn vol to take your opponents creatures to whack them with.  Primarily what makes the ability so attractive is actually the amount of combat tricks you can play with it.  Imagine you sneak a token past your opponents defenses, play a colossal might on it to do 5, then sacrifice it to do another 5, for a total of 10.  You could also put a devour creature into play, devour everything else for a huge creature, then throw it at your opponent for an immediate game finisher.  If one of your creatures has first strike, it can also do damage, then be sacrificed to do all its damage a second time.

If the game goes on too long, you can just tap all your lands, sacrifice them to Ib to turn them into Goblins, then sacrifice all of those to use whatever x-cost burn spell you choose.

If the game goes on too long, you can just tap all your lands, sacrifice them to Ib to turn them into Goblins, then sacrifice all of those to use whatever x-cost burn spell you choose. If you've been playing goblins throughout the whole game, you can easily drop a 14 or 15-damage Fireball on your opponents on turn five or six.\n\nIt was an OK idea, but it just doesn't seem all that plausible that you'll win with the deck.",

Your opponent can still attack/block/destroy vigor, or use destroy on your other creatures, because destroy effects are not damage.

Finding a way to give it any type of shroud, or play a clone or followed footsteps to get multiples of it might end the game though it would take time.  In some ways its better to get a creature thats going to end the game for you vs. hopefully buffing up a few of your other creatures, its about risk vs. reward, and have to remember that when trying to play vigor.

I personally have a lot of mana accel in my deck, and choose to play lavalanche, if I need to play it early 5 mana hurts my opponent for 2 and kills all their faeries and it's completely one sided.  Later on the x cost can be large enough to take down their big creatures too.",

We'll take 30+54+102+198+390 and add that to his base p/t of 6. We already did that though. For HB5, we did all that math, except we didn't add the 390. So we'll just add 390 to 390 and call it good?

Counters are extremely useful because they can be played around with so much.  There's a lot of blue and green cards that can move counters around to your other creatures, Green has the powerful card &quot;Doubling Season&quot;, and in the Scars of Mirrodin block, you have the mechanic Proliferate.

This plays deeply into the flavor of the incredibly gifted wonderful artists of classic dark fiction writers like Edgar Allen Poe, HP Lovecraft, the people who wrote about horror and science fiction stories in pulp magazines. While many more modern interpretations of the originals have played up the Monstrous and the Horrifying aspects, and put them in a more dramatic setting and made it look like the Universal Studios Monsters that Innistrad was largely built on, In LORWYN, we see Faeries, BLACK Faeries, who harken back to the ORIGINAL version of these stories- the Dreaminess of them- back when 'phantasmal' and 'fantastic' didn't mean 'ghostly' or 'great', but 'subconscious/psychological' and 'weird/strange'.  <br /><br />If you look at all the other Black Discard effects in Magic, you could easily imagine someone with Nicol Bolas' or Liliana Vess' personality type really relishing getting into the flavor of the spell, and how you are supposed to FEEL when you cast it. While I suppose, on power level and by reason of usefulness of its effect, Thoughtseize would be desired as a weapon by them, I just don't see it as their STYLE.  They aren't like the Faeries of Lorwyn.  It's nothing at all like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought Hemorrhage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Thought Hemorrhage\">Thought Hemorrhage</a>, which is very clearly focused on the owner of the thought, and how much joy their pain gives you. You are thinking more about the target player then about the spells they lose when you look at Thought Hemorrhage's art. With Thoughtseize, just the opposite is true: We can't see the (is it an?) elf's face, except half of their ear- we don't really know who is having their dream stolen at all. We DO see the Dream itself, and we see the faerie taking it, and....it just seems like the focus is entirely different. We wonder what's in that dream. What's in any Dream? What is a Dream?<br /><br />I see it as something different, nearly unique in Magic. And I think people are drawn just as much to this oddness as a spell that doesn't appear to be so malicious, a spell that might be of ambiguous moral quality, as much as they are drawn to everything else about it. Certainly I don't think Hymn to Tourach will ever be able to compete with it in this regard- Hymn to Tourach, flavorfully, is relatively boring, and reminds me of a simple ritual a bad guy, or a bad guy's minions, from D&amp;D might cast to do something bad to you.

Just because you can only play one of those cards, you get to play the *best* one of those cards. If that's the 7th card, that was 7 turns away. <br /><br />This card actually works very well now that I've tried it out.
