So in situations where you have 1 U to float, you get roughly the same effect (turning U into 3 colorless vs. getting 2 colorless from nothing mana-wise); in situations where you don't have the extra mana sitting around, this guy is a 1/1 chump blocker for 3 whereas [autocard]Palladium Myr[/autocard] can still be activated.  Plus, the Myr is a 2/2, and takes colorless mana.\n\nSo as much as I hate to say it, unless you're running wizard tribal or something, this guy's time has passed.  R.I.P. buddy. =(",

That's saying a fair amount and the real point is that Mishra's Factory is SWEETNESS. ",

The only 2 that were interesting enough to me to go out and buy were <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague Sliver\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Plague Sliver\">Plague Sliver</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian Obliterator\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Phyrexian Obliterator\">Phyrexian Obliterator</a>.  <br />The Sliver is nice, except that having 2 or 3 of him on the table is a problem, rather then super exciting like it is with Juzam.  The 'bonus' of having the Sliver hose Sliver decks is marginal in my eyes.  In the 20 years ive been playing magic MAYBE half of 1% of the games Ive played have been against Sliver decks.  Even still I stuck 1 of them in my deck and kind of consider him my 5th Juzam.  (yes like the 5th beatle)<br />The Obliterator is an awesome looking card.  I briefly replaced all of my Juzams with Obliterators. Briefly. I play a black and blue deck, and it's really much harder to get <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /> then it is to get <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" />.  MUCH harder.  Almost all of my lands produce <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /> and <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" />, but even still it was taking me much longer to put the Obliterator down then it was to get the Juzam out.  Most of my artifact mana, my <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana Drains\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mana Drains\">Mana Drains</a>, and all those awesome lands that provide colorless mana are useless in getting out the Obliterator. Even in a vintage mono black deck, <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" />  is much harder to get then <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" />.  At  the very least there's going to be 4 moxes and the <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol Ring\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sol Ring\">Sol Ring</a> that dont produce <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /> and probably some lands as well. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library of Alexandria\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Library of Alexandria\">Library of Alexandria</a>,  <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stripmine\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Stripmine\">Stripmine</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wasteland\">Wasteland</a> just to name a few.<br />Some other cards that people have suggested to replace Juzam, and my reasons why they're wrong:<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name= Tombstalker\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\" Tombstalker\"> Tombstalker</a>: it costs <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=4&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"4\" align=\"absbottom\" /> more. Unless I have a bunch of cards in my graveyard that I dont want to access later, and Im always hoping to play my Juzams on the first few turns. There just arent usually enough cards in my graveyard that early in the game. Flying is nice though.<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian Scuta\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Phyrexian Scuta\">Phyrexian Scuta</a>: It's costing me 3 life just to get him on the table as strong as Juzam.  By the time Juzam has cost me 3 life Ive had the chance to attack with him 3 times.

   "text_posted": " hands down the best creature in magic for the first 6 or 8 years. I mean, is it even close?\nstill very playable today\n[2BlackBlack] is easy to get on the first or second turn in a vintage deck, and his drawback isnt really much\nlots of people have suggested lots of creatures that they consider to be better then Juzam, most of those creatures seem like much worse choices to me.  The only 2 that were interesting enough to me to go out and buy were [autocard]Plague Sliver[/autocard] and [autocard]Phyrexian Obliterator[/autocard].  \nThe Sliver is nice, except that having 2 or 3 of him on the table is a problem, rather then super exciting like it is with Juzam.  The 'bonus' of having the Sliver hose Sliver decks is marginal in my eyes.  In the 20 years ive been playing magic MAYBE half of 1% of the games Ive played have been against Sliver decks.  Even still I stuck 1 of them in my deck and kind of consider him my 5th Juzam.  (yes like the 5th beatle)\nThe Obliterator is an awesome looking card.  I briefly replaced all of my Juzams with Obliterators. Briefly. I play a black and blue deck, and it's really much harder to get [BlackBlackBlackBlack] then it is to get [2BlackBlack].  MUCH harder.  Almost all of my lands produce [Black] and [U], but even still it was taking me much longer to put the Obliterator down then it was to get the Juzam out.  Most of my artifact mana, my [autocard]Mana Drains[/autocard], and all those awesome lands that provide colorless mana are useless in getting out the Obliterator. Even in a vintage mono black deck, [BlackBlackBlackBlack]  is much harder to get then [2BlackBlack].  At  the very least there's going to be 4 moxes and the [autocard]Sol Ring[/autocard] that dont produce [Black] and probably some lands as well. [autocard]Library of Alexandria[/autocard],  [autocard]Stripmine[/autocard], [autocard]Wasteland[/autocard] just to name a few.\nSome other cards that people have suggested to replace Juzam, and my reasons why they're wrong:\n[autocard] Tombstalker[/autocard]: it costs [4] more. Unless I have a bunch of cards in my graveyard that I dont want to access later, and Im always hoping to play my Juzams on the first few turns. There just arent usually enough cards in my graveyard that early in the game. Flying is nice though.\n[autocard]Phyrexian Scuta[/autocard]: It's costing me 3 life just to get him on the table as strong as Juzam.  By the time Juzam has cost me 3 life Ive had the chance to attack with him 3 times.  The only upside is swapping a [Black] to a [1].\n[autocard]Abyssal Persecutor[/autocard]: cool card, no doubt.  But not really a replacement for the Juzam.  Obviously you'd need to have a deck built around the idea of sacrificing your own creatures.  [autocard] Lord of the Pit[/autocard] or something similar.  In that type of deck, the Persecutor is a great card, but in any other kind of deck you simply can't win the game.  Juzam works in any black deck.\n[autocard]Vampire Outcasts[/autocard]: Under a specific condition it's a 4/4 for the same casting cost.  Lifelink is great.  But once again, thinking about playing my [2BlackBlack] creature on the first or second turn, it's most likely my first creature and my opponent has most likely not taken damage that turn. So he's most likely a 2/2. And if im going to play a creature that can get killed by a [autocard]Lightning Bolt[/autocard] it might as well be the [autocard]Hypnotic Specter[[/autocard] for one less mana and flying and random discard.\n[autocard]Grinning Demon[/autocard] He's a 6/6 instead of a 5/5 but he costs you 2 life per turn instead of 1.  Maybe Im just not understanding the Morph ability, but it seems practically useless to me to turn my 6/6 creature into a 2/2 creature just to lower the casting cost by 1.  Then I still have to pay his full casting cost to really make use of him.\nAnd thats why I still play with 4 Juzams in my deck 21 years after he was printed.  ",

I feel they need to rework the zones a little bit more if they plan on doing this, and call cards that were never in the game to begin with the \"Twilight Zone\" or \"Out of My Ass Zone\" or whatever. This way they could rewrite the text on cards like these to include both zones, and the mechanics would work the same. If every card that ever existed was always in a \"Zone\" even if you weren't playing then we would know what cards were being referred to because it would state which zone they are in.",

On the card it clearly states (with minor translation for modern wording):\n\"0: Exile target creature card from any graveyard. Untap Eater of the Dead.\"\n\nNow, if the concern was that this essentially gave him vigilance, this worry is defeated by modern wording using \"target;\" if there are no creature cards you wish to remove, you can declare no targets for the ability and Eater can't untap.  The way its Oracle wording is, you can only activate this if he is tapped which is not implied in the base card.  Perhaps this is considered too strong, but that's what old cards were.  If you don't like its wording, print a new card with this new wording.",

   "text_posted": "In the image released with the name of the next block [b]Innnistrad[/b], it looks like [autocard]Irini Sengir[/autocard] is on a throne gloating while this guy is seriously hurt on the floor to the left. Combine the picture, the tagline 'Horror lurks within', and the fact that we have had cards such as [autocard]barony vampire[/autocard] and [autocard]vampire aristocrat[/autocard] that specifically talk about Baron sengirs realm, I would say we are returning to the homelands plotline. Now that vampire is black's tribal, we should see a lot of interactions there as the Sengirs finally lead their armies out of the dwarven portal to who knows where.

If you subtracted 99999999999999999 from infinity, the total would still be infinity. Which leaves the question how could subtracting 1/3 of infinity from infinity = infinity? There is no way to comprehend the number infinity with the human mind. Imagine if i tried to actually write all the numbers down. The 9999999999999999 would keep going off the edge of your computer screen and circle the entire planet. That would be far to large to understand or count, but those 99999999's would keep going past the edge of the universe. Now our galaxy is 100 million light years across, with 100 billion stars in it. their is 100 billion estimated known galaxy's. To put this in perspective, the furthest mankind has ever traveled in space since the dawn of man, 9.7 billion miles from our sun. We are just now barley leaving our solar system, an nowhere near the closest star. But if you were to zoom out on a picture of the entire universe, eventually the picture would become very dark and the entire universe would look like a star. This must be the case, unless you are claiming that our universe has no edge, meaning it has no beginning and no end. In this way, our universe is both infinitely big and infinitely small depending on perspective. To us its infinitely big, but with this logic in reality its actually just infinitely small.<br /><br /><br />How did this all come from nothing? God is the only logical answer, unless you think spontaneous generation makes sense.",

Read their statement on it, rather than whine about it and throw blame around.<br /><br />As for this card itself... yeah, in 3+ games it can help keep you alive (being the Mana Outsource), but in one-on-one... this should be more of a win condition.

Since all you have to do is think \"1+1=2, so 2+2=4\" to keep your mana straight, you only had to watch how you cast odd-cost cards, saving the little [1]-cost cards to fill the blanks, maybe.\nHowever, as skilled players show... paying life for a winning advantage is worth the loss... because you'll win.\nOf course, with numerous methods to produce more than one mana with a land, that becomes totally moot, with the only problem being maybe casting super-low-cost cards late in the game, or if the boost gets too high too early in the game (for about... one turn).\n\nThey took out Mana Burn because it has simply become no more than a MINOR HINDRANCE at best, a ONE-TURN-WIN strategy at worst. Read their statement on it, rather than whine about it and throw blame around.\n\nAs for this card itself... yeah, in 3+ games it can help keep you alive (being the Mana Outsource), but in one-on-one... this should be more of a win condition. Done right, that's how it works, since you set it down just before blowing out on the expensive stuff, which are now functionally half-cost, even effect costs.",

This thing is incredibly useful- taking out the 3 main permanent types (barring Planeswalkers, of course) and provides an out for non-white decks to take out a permanent type that they normally cannot.

   "text_posted": "I think we have a bad case of \"misreading the card\". You do not need to regenerate a goblin. You can regenerate anything, no matter what creature type. However, you must sacrifice a goblin. Do not sacrifice, say, a kithkin to get a goblin back. That is wrong. Saccing a goblin for a goblin is fine, just remember, you can regen anything.\r\n\r\nBack to the card...\r\n\r\nI run this guy in my goblin deck along with [autocard]tuktuk the explorer[/autocard] and [autocard]Ib halfheart, goblin tactician[/autocard]. He is incredible. Getting him out early, and the \"free\" ability is definately worth it. First turn, mountain, [autocard]raging goblin[/autocard], Second turn, mountain, [autocard]akki rockspeaker[/autocard], this guy. Third turn, [autocard]mogg alarm[/autocard]. Pretty much anyone you need regenerated can and will come back. A whole horde of invincible goblins is fine by me.

And, @ Weretarrasque, it is so good because it can lock your opponent down to just two or three lands beginning on the third or fourth turn (depending on your mana acceleration): <br />Turn 1: Forest, Llanowar Elves/Birds of Paradise (You play first)<br />Opponent's turn: Plays land, 1 land out<br />Turn 2: Island, Time Elemental<br />Opponent's Turn: Plays land, 2 lands out<br />Turn 3: Island, activate Time Elemental<br />Opponent's turn: Plays land, 2 lands out<br /><br />This combo is insanely brutal and not even too tricky to pull off. Run Force of Wills to support it (Turn Aside if you're willing to wait a turn/on a budget) and Wastelands for complete lockdown. <br /><br />Repeatable bounce is not to be underestimated; this guy is actually pretty good in EDH since you can bounce their general which, I'm assuming costs a lot. You can also bounce one big threat each turn.

And, @ Weretarrasque, it is so good because it can lock your opponent down to just two or three lands beginning on the third or fourth turn (depending on your mana acceleration): \nTurn 1: Forest, Llanowar Elves/Birds of Paradise (You play first)\nOpponent's turn: Plays land, 1 land out\nTurn 2: Island, Time Elemental\nOpponent's Turn: Plays land, 2 lands out\nTurn 3: Island, activate Time Elemental\nOpponent's turn: Plays land, 2 lands out\n\nThis combo is insanely brutal and not even too tricky to pull off. Run Force of Wills to support it (Turn Aside if you're willing to wait a turn/on a budget) and Wastelands for complete lockdown. \n\nRepeatable bounce is not to be underestimated; this guy is actually pretty good in EDH since you can bounce their general which, I'm assuming costs a lot. You can also bounce one big threat each turn. Since EDH is a mana-intensive format, it'll probably take a good chunk of whichever schmuck's mana you choose to keep replacing their [autocard]Wild Pair[/autocard] or whatever.",
