   "text_parsed": "Well, the first thing I'd like to say is, that with any of the 'basic effect' spells (pump, damage, destroy target, draw, life gain) you should ask yourselves: Why this, over any other card?<br /><br />This is <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" /> for +6/+6. it's delayed, and it's not as good as direct damage or counters, but it still has the potential to be a pretty big effect. I think that, considering it CAN be a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava Axe\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lava Axe\">Lava Axe</a> if things go quite well for you, and that it does interact well with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaplasm\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Manaplasm\">Manaplasm</a>-types (which includes both casts being copyable), and that it can target different creatures, that <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=3&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"3\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" /> is actually OK for the hard cast.<br /><br />The knobs that I'm not sure whether they could turn a bit sharper are: number of time counters; suspend cost; speed; number of suspend turns.<br /><br />3 turns and 3 counters is I think a harder cost than the cast. After all, Green is the color of mana dorks, and after looking at lots of high-costing cards that turned out to be plenty well playable because the effects were strong, if they had changed it to Suspend 1 and 1 Time Counter, then the card would have been very good. Also might have been a rare.<br /><br />Instant vs. Sorcery speed is a tricky thing to judge. If this card has as much potential as I think it does, it may not need Instant speed. Sorcery speed pumping would normally want instant speed for combat tactics, but if you're pumping big enough, you can play pump like Lava Axe instead of like Lightning Bolt, and be fine.<br /><br />Either changing how much time it takes to work, or changing the Suspend cost to <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" /> to match Giant Growth, would have made this card twice as good as it is, and it's already playable.

   "text_posted": "Well, the first thing I'd like to say is, that with any of the 'basic effect' spells (pump, damage, destroy target, draw, life gain) you should ask yourselves: Why this, over any other card?\n\nThis is [2][G] for +6/+6. it's delayed, and it's not as good as direct damage or counters, but it still has the potential to be a pretty big effect. I think that, considering it CAN be a [autocard]Lava Axe[/autocard] if things go quite well for you, and that it does interact well with [autocard]Manaplasm[/autocard]-types (which includes both casts being copyable), and that it can target different creatures, that [3][G][G] is actually OK for the hard cast.\n\nThe knobs that I'm not sure whether they could turn a bit sharper are: number of time counters; suspend cost; speed; number of suspend turns.\n\n3 turns and 3 counters is I think a harder cost than the cast. After all, Green is the color of mana dorks, and after looking at lots of high-costing cards that turned out to be plenty well playable because the effects were strong, if they had changed it to Suspend 1 and 1 Time Counter, then the card would have been very good. Also might have been a rare.\n\nInstant vs. Sorcery speed is a tricky thing to judge. If this card has as much potential as I think it does, it may not need Instant speed. Sorcery speed pumping would normally want instant speed for combat tactics, but if you're pumping big enough, you can play pump like Lava Axe instead of like Lightning Bolt, and be fine.\n\nEither changing how much time it takes to work, or changing the Suspend cost to [G] to match Giant Growth, would have made this card twice as good as it is, and it's already playable. But remember- every little change on a card like this has more impact than you think it does, and changing it to:\n\n[2][G][G]\nInstant\n1 time counter\n[G] Suspend 1\n\nWould have been a LOT better than Giant Growth, and probably better than Overrun.",

But you can see how 1 mana for 1 card is looking good, now make it an instant and your deck can be ~56 cards\n\nLastly, the effect itself is super gold, I mean, flash a creature? That can be used in so many ways, it is awesome.\n\nBut my main point stands, this card is great where you can use its ability (of Flash) the fact that it could be used in quite a lot of decks as just filler makes it awesome.",

Stick the sword and the wings on Saltskitter, and you'll likely get through with flying. Let the Wings resolve first, and you'll get three 1/1 tokens, causing Saltskitter to phase out. Then let Worldslayer wipe the board, and Saltskitter should phase back in at the end of your turn, with a path open to attack.\n\nSo there you have it, a use for the Saltskitter. Not the best combo, sure, but it's fun.",

   "text_parsed": "Nacatl War-Pride is one of the coolest cards in Magic: The Gathering, in my opinion. Everything about it makes it interesting as opposed to just bluntly powerful. A high mana cost and low power/toughness are offset by a blocker restriction that makes defending against it tricky and a massive self-cloning trigger that seems capable of ending games. The question is how to make that happen, and the War-Pride does a fantastic job balancing that potential for abuse with its overall power level (&gt;9000 if your opponent has at least 3000 creatures).<br /><br />I second the wonderful suggestions to use this with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion of Lambholt\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Champion of Lambholt\">Champion of Lambholt</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundial of the Infinite\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sundial of the Infinite\">Sundial of the Infinite</a>, and/or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallel Lives\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Parallel Lives\">Parallel Lives</a>.<br /><br />Although Champion of Lambholt is probably the coolest suggestion for unblockability (and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing Tanglewurm\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Bellowing Tanglewurm\">Bellowing Tanglewurm</a> is pretty sweet too), <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Bedlam\">Bedlam</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falter\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Falter\">Falter</a> are also good options, especially with them being less vulnerable to typical removal. They're red, though. You could also combo <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya Dryad\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Yavimaya Dryad\">Yavimaya Dryad</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumbering Satyr\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lumbering Satyr\">Lumbering Satyr</a>, with the advantage being that it's respectably ridiculous. <br /><br />I also agree that <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cytoshape\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Cytoshape\">Cytoshape</a> (in response to the token-creating triggered ability) would be amusing. I’d Cytoshape the War-Pride into a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof Behemoth\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Craterhoof Behemoth\">Craterhoof Behemoth</a>.<br /><br />Speaking of making copies of the wrong thing, has anyone else thought about following this with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence of the Wild\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Essence of the Wild\">Essence of the Wild</a>? Not that it's that great, since they still don't have any sort of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136288\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"136288\">evasion</a>, but comboing two cards with the same unusual mana cost does amuse me. Hey, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vigor\">Vigor</a> would stop the original War-Pride from getting killed in combat...<br /><br />Also, I'd love to play Nacatl War-Pride with a few <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade Doppelganger\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Renegade Doppelganger\">Renegade Doppelganger</a>s and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Clone\">Clone</a>s thereof. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heat Shimmer\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Heat Shimmer\">Heat Shimmer</a> would also work, I guess, but it'll only last a turn. Really, I just want to attack with multiple Nacatl War-Prides at once, ideally before my opponent has a chance to figure out what I'm up to. Like by using <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dual Nature\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dual Nature\">Dual Nature</a>/<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild Pair\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wild Pair\">Wild Pair</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concordant Crossroads\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Concordant Crossroads\">Concordant Crossroads</a>...or by using <b><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mirrorweave\">Mirrorweave</a></b> with mana dorks and weenies aplenty. And for multi-turn overkill, there's always <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite Reflection\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Infinite Reflection\">Infinite Reflection</a>. Even a measly 2 vs. 3 matchup sends at least 15 damage through, and if you used Mirrorweave, all blocks will be lethal to everything involved...unless you happen to have <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline of Vitality\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Leyline of Vitality\">Leyline of Vitality</a> or some other toughness-booster. Cool story bro.<br /><br />While we're overkilling, we might as well run <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat of Arms\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Coat of Arms\">Coat of Arms</a>. It's actually pretty good with Nacatl War-Pride on its own. If your opponent is playing tribal, it'll almost even out, but if they aren't playing tribal and you have some way of forcing the combat damage through, it'll be devastating. Too bad green is so bad at giving all its creatures trample.<br /><br /><br />One problem with Nacatl War-Pride though is that it doesn't really do its thing all that well if your opponent doesn't have enough creatures. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted Troll\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Hunted Troll\">Hunted Troll</a> seems like the simplest way to fix that problem, but the more devious option is <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural Affinity\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Natural Affinity\">Natural Affinity</a>/<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living Plane\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Living Plane\">Living Plane</a>. If you go down that road, consider <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran Explorer\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Veteran Explorer\">Veteran Explorer</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective Voyage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Collective Voyage\">Collective Voyage</a>/<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New Frontiers\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"New Frontiers\">New Frontiers</a>. If you want to send damage through, you could use <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana Web\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mana Web\">Mana Web</a> to try to keep them tapped down.<br /><br />Another problem is how the original War-Pride will likely end up dead, meaning its first attack will be its last. Unblockability, at least for the original, is probably the best solution, but <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifeline\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lifeline\">Lifeline</a> will also probably work, since you will always be attacking with at least one more attacker than they have blockers, meaning that at least one will probably survive combat, which gives it a chance to make it to the end of the turn and revive all dead creatures (including your opponent's too, which is unfortunate unless you want them to have larger numbers of creatures for some reason). Any card with the &quot;Populate&quot; mechanic - especially <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootborn Defenses\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rootborn Defenses\">Rootborn Defenses</a> - is another option, since Populate can create a token Nacatl War-Pride that won't be exiled with the other tokens and won't be in combat. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trostani, Selesnya's Voice\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Trostani, Selesnya's Voice\">Trostani, Selesnya's Voice</a> seems good too, due to the massive, massive life gain.<br /><br />Overall, though, it's a fun, interesting card that inspires people to find ways to tap its hidden potential.

A 2/2 for <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=3&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"3\" align=\"absbottom\" /> sucks, a colorless land is pretty bad. The land doesn't enter tapped though, which is a big plus. The combination opens up several possibilities.<br /><br />1.) Making dual use of land slots is always good. Morph decks can have more morph creatures in their land slots. If you are building around morph, you want some creatures to mask your real threats, and you can use some of those 20 or so slots you are 'wasting' on mana production to fit in some bears. Sometimes a 2/2 is the difference between winning and losing.<br /><br />2.) Card advantage. Playing this as a creature, if your opponent fires a spell at it you can flip it. Their spell will fizzle. (Unless it can also target a land.) Remember that nothing can be done in response to flipping a morph card. It does not use the stack. Obviously this was better before M10 when you could put combat damage on the stack then suddenly have a land. Still, as long as you have <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /> open, your bear is going to suddenly become a land if it would die, that's useful.<br /><br />3.) Obfuscation. I have messed with even pretty good players with this card. Morph cards are an unknown, when your opponent sees you flip one Zoetic Cavern, their confidence in their ability to destroy your morphs goes way down. Better players won't be as effected, but the psychological effect of morph is always something to consider.<br /><br />4.) Ramp. Sure <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=3&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"3\" align=\"absbottom\" /> then <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /> is a lot to pay to get one land on the field if you look at it that way. But you can just play this as the face down creature, use it as such, then when you need to you can flip it at the end of an opponent's turn. (Say you are playing control and they didn't cast anything worth countering) and you get to your finishing move one turn earlier. Blue and white can't ramp much, and because you can tap it right after unmorphing it, you can unmorph with <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" /> in your mana pool, then tap this again for <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana Leak\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mana Leak\">Mana Leak</a>. I do this a lot.<br /><br />5.) Its fun. No one says what the criteria is for rating a card. You may say power, but a more casual player may rate down <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster Mage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Snapcaster Mage\">Snapcaster Mage</a> because it's too powerful and recursion is annoying in the hands of blue, the come here and rate a 5 for all the good times they've had flipping this out of combat.

Early game as you can cast it for free on turn two or keep it as a blocker card (IE time saver) latter on.\n\nI played a deck that ran a set in a local extended tournament and took first... it was a small tournament but I did get to beat down on all-in-red, hypo, zoo, Thopter Foundry, boros, Faeries... and other rouge decks for a clear all out win.\n\nPS... I was playing a token/convoke deck main decking [autocard] Cord of Calling[/autocard]  and [autocard] Mycolth [/autocard].\n\n",

Unfortunately, his life total can be quite a bit higher than that by turn six if I'm not careful...but it keeps things interesting.\n\nTrue story. I can't make this stuff up. \"Harmful Stranger\" vs. \"Killing Gentleman\". Stories of these decks' exploits will be passed on to Wizards' grandchildren.",

   "text_parsed": "@DeathParallax: <br />I know I shouldn't be feeding trolls, but there are a few things you're ignoring about this card:<br />First off, in Standard, this is by no means a broken or degenerate engine. The deck it would most likely go into would be a self-milling shell- continue to pay mana investment over a period of several turns as build-up to getting off your combo, in relatively small increments, usually no more than 2 or 3 cards, and then it would probably try to run on a basic Messenger+Gravecrawler+Sac outlet loop to try to get a few zombies. Sure, if the combo gets working, it more or less wins the game. Getting an army of zombies tends to do that. However, there are problems with that- the Zombies don't have Haste, and so are vunerable to Wraths for a turn, the fact that a single <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Shock\">Shock</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mortarpod\">Mortarpod</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fume Spitter\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fume Spitter\">Fume Spitter</a> would prevent the combo from ever going off, and the fact that a single Surgical Extraction would destroy the deck's main engine. Without the cards that fuel Legacy dredge decks- as in, cards with Dredge, Ichorids, Sacrifice a creature Flashback costs, and so on, Bridge from Below is an odd build-around-me card that doesn't break formats in half. Look at Modern, for example- without Dread Return, Cabal Therapy, or Ichorids, Dredge as a deck doesn't really exist. In standard, there's even less fuel to build the deck with. Also, just because Manaless Ichorid doesn't get better with Black Lotus doesn't mean that somehow, magically, Black Lotus becomes a worse card, or somehow not the best card in the entire game. Long.dec with 4 Black Lotuses would beat Manaless Ichorid on just about any day of the week. Plus, given that most dredge decks nowadays use Lion's Eye Diamond, I would say that Black Lotus would have a place in dredge decks if it were allowed.<br /><br />As for everyone who's hating on dredge: Why? Why all the hate? Because there is a deck that costs less than the dual lands your deck relies on to run that can beat you? Because there is some form of degenerate combo deck that you can't interact with, unlike fan favorites such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High Tide\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"High Tide\">High Tide</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charbelcher\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Charbelcher\">Charbelcher</a>? Because if you stop the combo, it can still play the game with a chance of winning, unlike Combo Elves? Because there are no decks like Maverick around that prey on Dredge decks? Dredge is a part of the Legacy Metagame as much as decks like Merfolk are. They are extremely powerful against much of the field, but weak to certain decks, and it's easy to board in hate against them. So please- stop treating dredge like it's something that ruined the game. It's a difficult matchup for many decks, and deserves respect from the sideboard. Such could be said about just about any other deck in the format. It's a part of the game, for good or ill, and trash talking the deck doesn't change the fact-  Dredge is here, to stay.",

   "text_parsed": "I'd like to prove I'm not a Troll. :P <br /><br />I've made genuinely good comments on lots of cards. Just because I'm everywhere, doesn't mean I'm a troll. I had a huge fumble on <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin, Lord of Innistrad\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sorin, Lord of Innistrad\">Sorin, Lord of Innistrad</a> ok I admit that was being silly :3<br /><br />But I'd like to say first in my defense that I posted my old comment having JUST discovered what Dredge was/that it existed. I had known for a while about <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate Dead\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Animate Dead\">Animate Dead</a>ing big dumb crap out of your graveyard. I'd know that while our favorite cards to try to cheat into play nowadays usually have anti-Reanimator clauses, what I DIDN'T know was that <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread Return\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dread Return\">Dread Return</a> was actually the best-freaking-most-retarded-makes-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial Rites\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Unburial Rites\">Unburial Rites</a>-look-like-trash card for Reanimating ever. I'd assumed <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Reanimate\">Reanimate</a> might be the best, since I'd assumed that your deck is always going to be <i>generating mana</i>. <br /><br />Then I learned that I'd assumed wrong. And OK I way overreacted. I might love to write as a Johnny, but I have an irrepressible urge to enjoy simple things that comes out as Starry-Eyed Timmy sometimes. WELL WHO WOULDN'T have kind of flipped their lid for a week trying to wrap their brains around &quot;ZOMG. Dredge...does...WHAT with card X?&quot; So my last post on this card looked like a Troll. :P Oops.<br /><br />I defend myself as simply trying to explain why it is still absolutely impossible for this card to be in Standard again, no matter how much you want it, no matter EVEN if maybe it is fair. It is like hoping the Artifact Lands might get printed in a Core Set without any mechanics in Standard to actually support them besides maybe creatures that get +1/+1 for counting all artifacts. Even if that doesn't sound too broken, (compared to most keyword mechanics involving artifacts breaking them in half), you -still- aren't going to get Bridge from Below reprinted, because I do think it and the other Dredge cards ARE black-listed by WOTC, the same way the Artifact Lands and probably the Vivid Lands are black-listed by them. <br /><br />&quot;Not Good For Standard&quot; is what R&amp;D thinks of the cards that really catch our attention as being super cool and powerful. We'll see <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact or Fiction\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fact or Fiction\">Fact or Fiction</a> again before we see Bridge from Below again. They'll give us <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning Bolt\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lightning Bolt\">Lightning Bolt</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana Leak\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mana Leak\">Mana Leak</a>, but they won't even give us <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse the Unthinkable\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Glimpse the Unthinkable\">Glimpse the Unthinkable</a>. (<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaking\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Breaking\">Breaking</a> has strictly worse art). They reprint great commons a lot, but great Rares they usually just don't, not in Standard. The Shock Lands are the only exception I can think of that makes my inner cynic shut and wonder if the future might hold some really crazy shit.<br /><br />You may be able to say they are being irrational, but I still believe there's a 0% chance of Bridge from Below being seen outside multiplayer reprint products.<br />I'm sorry it was hard to read between the lines the last time I was fangasming over Dredge, but I actually was being Truthful when I said it 'Dethroned Black Lotus&quot;<br /><br />Bazaar of Baghdad and Black Lotus conditionally TIE for &quot;Best Card in the Game&quot;. Black Lotus will be Best in a huge majority of situations, but Bazaar of Baghdad's claim to fame is that it ALSO is a 0-cost, gets-you-three-of-something card that will plain win you the game by degenerate combo, and is almost impossible to disrupt. The Power Nine are half-Blue because of how consistent they make your deck, and the Consistency of Dredge is something that needs to be respected. <br /><br />&quot;Players expect they will just lose Game 1&quot;. That's not just Kitchen Table players, that's Professional Players who do things with cardboard that make the rest of us go 'wait what just happened?!'

   "text_posted": "I'd like to prove I'm not a Troll. :P \n\nI've made genuinely good comments on lots of cards. Just because I'm everywhere, doesn't mean I'm a troll. I had a huge fumble on [autocard]Sorin, Lord of Innistrad[/autocard] ok I admit that was being silly :3\n\nBut I'd like to say first in my defense that I posted my old comment having JUST discovered what Dredge was/that it existed. I had known for a while about [autocard]Animate Dead[/autocard]ing big dumb crap out of your graveyard. I'd know that while our favorite cards to try to cheat into play nowadays usually have anti-Reanimator clauses, what I DIDN'T know was that [autocard]Dread Return[/autocard] was actually the best-freaking-most-retarded-makes-[autocard]Unburial Rites[/autocard]-look-like-trash card for Reanimating ever. I'd assumed [autocard]Reanimate[/autocard] might be the best, since I'd assumed that your deck is always going to be [i]generating mana[/i]. \n\nThen I learned that I'd assumed wrong. And OK I way overreacted. I might love to write as a Johnny, but I have an irrepressible urge to enjoy simple things that comes out as Starry-Eyed Timmy sometimes. WELL WHO WOULDN'T have kind of flipped their lid for a week trying to wrap their brains around \"ZOMG. Dredge...does...WHAT with card X?\" So my last post on this card looked like a Troll. :P Oops.\n\nI defend myself as simply trying to explain why it is still absolutely impossible for this card to be in Standard again, no matter how much you want it, no matter EVEN if maybe it is fair. It is like hoping the Artifact Lands might get printed in a Core Set without any mechanics in Standard to actually support them besides maybe creatures that get +1/+1 for counting all artifacts. Even if that doesn't sound too broken, (compared to most keyword mechanics involving artifacts breaking them in half), you -still- aren't going to get Bridge from Below reprinted, because I do think it and the other Dredge cards ARE black-listed by WOTC, the same way the Artifact Lands and probably the Vivid Lands are black-listed by them. \n\n\"Not Good For Standard\" is what R&D thinks of the cards that really catch our attention as being super cool and powerful. We'll see [autocard]Fact or Fiction[/autocard] again before we see Bridge from Below again. They'll give us [autocard]Lightning Bolt[/autocard] and [autocard]Mana Leak[/autocard], but they won't even give us [autocard]Glimpse the Unthinkable[/autocard]. ([autocard]Breaking[/autocard] has strictly worse art). They reprint great commons a lot, but great Rares they usually just don't, not in Standard. The Shock Lands are the only exception I can think of that makes my inner cynic shut and wonder if the future might hold some really crazy shit.\n\nYou may be able to say they are being irrational, but I still believe there's a 0% chance of Bridge from Below being seen outside multiplayer reprint products.\nI'm sorry it was hard to read between the lines the last time I was fangasming over Dredge, but I actually was being Truthful when I said it 'Dethroned Black Lotus\"\n\nBazaar of Baghdad and Black Lotus conditionally TIE for \"Best Card in the Game\". Black Lotus will be Best in a huge majority of situations, but Bazaar of Baghdad's claim to fame is that it ALSO is a 0-cost, gets-you-three-of-something card that will plain win you the game by degenerate combo, and is almost impossible to disrupt. The Power Nine are half-Blue because of how consistent they make your deck, and the Consistency of Dredge is something that needs to be respected. \n\n\"Players expect they will just lose Game 1\". That's not just Kitchen Table players, that's Professional Players who do things with cardboard that make the rest of us go 'wait what just happened?!' ALL the time, in Standard, Modern, Limited, and Legacy. They top deck [autocard]Cruel Ultimatum[/autocard]s and [autocard]Lightning Helix[/autocard]es and make it look like it was the plan all along, and they can beat you with an Intro Pack versus your Premium Deck because they are a better player than you. THAT kind of player goes to Vintage and expects to just lose Game 1 versus Dredge, when they've BEATEN all kinds of Lotus-driven decks some percentage of the time 30 or greater to get there. \n\nThat's why \"Black Lotus is CONDITIONALLY the Best Card, nearly all the time, Except when [autocard]Bazaar of Baghdad[/autocard] is better\" is a fair and valid sentence.",

Sure it's absolutely increadible as far as an efficient dumb beater goes. But that's all it is. It doesn't even have trample or any other evasion. Yes almost everything dies to removal, but this dies to almost all removal. It doesn't accelerate you in a broken way like black lotus, it doesn't give you broken card advantage like ancestral recall. It doesn't decimate your opponents board like balance. It just beats on them. I just wall it early and remove it late with plenty of answers to spare. And sometimes I'll let him be, I've outpaced my opponent. And this is with a $30 budget deck. And don't even try to tell me he can get to 8/9. When does that happen? He's usually between 3/4 and 5/6. For 1G? Yes very efficient, yes a great card.

Sure it's absolutely increadible as far as an efficient dumb beater goes. But that's all it is. It doesn't even have trample or any other evasion. Yes almost everything dies to removal, but this dies to almost all removal. It doesn't accelerate you in a broken way like black lotus, it doesn't give you broken card advantage like ancestral recall. It doesn't decimate your opponents board like balance. It just beats on them. I just wall it early and remove it late with plenty of answers to spare. And sometimes I'll let him be, I've outpaced my opponent. And this is with a $30 budget deck. And don't even try to tell me he can get to 8/9. When does that happen? He's usually between 3/4 and 5/6. For 1G? Yes very efficient, yes a great card. But I'll take him down with [i][autocard]dust elemental[/autocard][/i]. ( yes I use dust elemental, don't judge )\n\nThat being said, he is an amazingly efficient beater with no reason not to run him. He generates the pressure control decks need and in almost all cases is their only form of early board presence ( aside from phyrexian dreadnought among others ). An easy 5/5. Not broken but he's as close as a dumb beater will get without getting really stupid dumb.\n\n@justicarphaeton\ngoyf doesn't even come CLOSE to [autocard]necropotence[/autocard] sorry",

There is almost no way neither person wont have a fetch land, a [autocard]wasteland[/autocard], a [autocard]strip mine[/autocard], a [autocard]ghost quarter[/autocard] or any other number of good stuff.\n\nBasically, in most control match ups, splash some green with dual lands and throw in a Goyf, you wont be disappointed. Even though he's losing some of his steeze to [autocard]Scavenging Ooze[/autocard]",
