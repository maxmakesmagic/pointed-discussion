Maro has talked about how counterspells are in white secondary more than a few times on his blog and elsewhere on the Internet, but other than the fantastic <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lapse of Certainty\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lapse of Certainty\">Lapse of Certainty</a>, there haven't been any others since <i>Planar Chaos</i>.  <br /><br />Perhaps their uniqueness is what makes them so special.  If we had a &quot;common white taxing or reactive counterspell&quot; in every limited environment, it would absolutely lose some of its magic, but I would still take that over our current model.  Blue's monopoly on counterspells is defended to the death by R&amp;D, but giving white low-impact ones could really create a depth in the color that wouldn't be stepping on blue's toes.  UW has become the tempo pair according to R&amp;D; what is more of a tempo play<br /><br />I also should note that I love one mana spells and I love reactive spells from a design standpoint.  Both are very difficult to craft effectively, but <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rebuff the Wicked\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rebuff the Wicked\">Rebuff the Wicked</a> is a very strong design and has resonated with many players.  The art is your standard proto-counterspell image, but still solid.  This is just what a visual representation of a counterspell according to most artists.  Maybe Terese Nielsen should have a crack at it again.<br /><br />It should be noted that <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith's Shield\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Faith's Shield\">Faith's Shield</a> essentially does the same thing as this with more room for upside, and in a more in-color method as well.  Players really don't like seeing &quot;counter target spell&quot; very much, and R&amp;D is a good listener.  It's a shame though, really.  <br /><br />But man, what a perfect name for the card.

Maro has talked about how counterspells are in white secondary more than a few times on his blog and elsewhere on the Internet, but other than the fantastic [autocard]Lapse of Certainty[/autocard], there haven't been any others since [i]Planar Chaos[/i].  \n\nPerhaps their uniqueness is what makes them so special.  If we had a \"common white taxing or reactive counterspell\" in every limited environment, it would absolutely lose some of its magic, but I would still take that over our current model.  Blue's monopoly on counterspells is defended to the death by R&D, but giving white low-impact ones could really create a depth in the color that wouldn't be stepping on blue's toes.  UW has become the tempo pair according to R&D; what is more of a tempo play\n\nI also should note that I love one mana spells and I love reactive spells from a design standpoint.  Both are very difficult to craft effectively, but [autocard]Rebuff the Wicked[/autocard] is a very strong design and has resonated with many players.  The art is your standard proto-counterspell image, but still solid.  This is just what a visual representation of a counterspell according to most artists.  Maybe Terese Nielsen should have a crack at it again.\n\nIt should be noted that [autocard]Faith's Shield[/autocard] essentially does the same thing as this with more room for upside, and in a more in-color method as well.  Players really don't like seeing \"counter target spell\" very much, and R&D is a good listener.  It's a shame though, really.  \n\nBut man, what a perfect name for the card.  Let's [autocard]Rebuff the Wicked[/autocard] the next time we throw down some cardboard! ",

Most people understand that green is not supposed to have flying, or blue is not supposed to have discard... but combat tricks?  Every color has combat tricks.  It's hard to focus on what makes this card come from an alternate reality, which is that this card is just a more powerful version of a combat trick for Red... you know... equal to Giant Growth, which is generally the best combat trick of any set it is printed in.<br /><br />As players, power level is our blind spot.  Many of us desire things to be better than they are, so they can go in our deck.  We don't play with Red's combat tricks very often, because Red's removal is generally better.  The tricks are printed as either a surprise, or as an interesting choice for limited.  This card, though, can be arguably better than Lightning Bolt in some decks.  It makes every other combat trick in Red look bad.  It makes a bunch of players desire red to have combat tricks as good as green.<br /><br />This wouldn't be a terrible problem... one color getting to do something about as well as the other colors spontaneously.  The color pie gets moved around all the time.  But, could you imagine if Planar Chaos did this to all the colors... giving them options that were just as good as good staples in normal standard?  If Scryb Sprites returned, people would argue for green to having flying at cheaper costs... since they already did it with Scryb Sprites.  If blue got a Mind Rot in Planar Chaos, people would start talking about how Blue should get better discard.  What if White got Gravedigger?<br /><br />The reason why my previous examples would have been bad choices for Planar Chaos is that they are very clean cards with exact ana1ogues to cards who do the job as well as them and are commonly played.  Making Drudge Skeleton White or Master Decoy Black for a set isn't a big deal, since Drudge Skeleton and Master Decoy were never 5 star cards anyway.  If Black got a Lightning Bolt, though, people would salivate for black to have more, since that card would be incredibly good.  It's the same case with Brute Force.

In fact, in some ways, Mirri is better.\n\n\"Although haste is nice, it's not difficult to get a blocker with 4 power out there on turn 4 or 5.\"\n\nA FLYING blocker, you mean? You'd be surprised how difficult it can be to get out a creature that can block and kill this quickly enough. In order to do that, a creature needs to be able to block creatures with flying and have at least 3 power (remember that due to first strike Mirri gets a +1/+1 counter before the blocker deals damage to her). Besides, if they do get out a big blocker, just use your removal on it.\n\n\"It's also not difficult to kill her with direct damage or counters.\"\n\nYou could say the same about Vampire Nighthawk.\n\n\"She doesn't really threaten to do very much beyond deal 3 damage per turn, starting turn 4.\"\n\nExcept she is also a pretty good blocker. Not to mention that 3 damage per turn is actually quite a lot, for a single creature. \n\n@NatalyNeeSama\n\nShe can fly because she is a vampire.\n\nThat made me think, most vampires turn into bats. So what would Mirri turn into? A cat-bat? A cbat? A bcat?",

Eye will exile your Spellshift, you can stack the Sleight and counter it with the copy of Spellshift. This will let you reveal cards from your library and cast the next instant or sorcery. When you cast it, Eye will exile it and you'll get to stack all three spells. Just stack Sleight and Spellshift again, and you'll end up putting every instant and sorcery in your library on Eye, and a crazy number of copies of each of the early spells.\r\n\r\nAs long as you have something like [autocard]Careful Consideration[/autocard] on there, you can deck your opponent easily. You can also stack a bunch of copies of [autocard]Walk the Aeons[/autocard] to take as many turns as you wanted. You could make the deck a lockout if you got [autocard]Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir[/autocard] in play, which means that if you opponent played an instant or sorcery, during their turn of course, Eye would exile it and give them copies, but Teferi wouldn't allow them to actually play the copies.\r\n\r\nBack before the changes to \"exile vs remove from game\", you could even have a Research ([autocard]Research//Development[/autocard]) in there, which could take spell cards off of the Eye and put them back in your library to go super-infinite. I suppose you can do the same thing if you run some flashback spells and [autocard]Runic Repetition[/autocard]. Or you can use [autocard]Pull from Eternity[/autocard] and [autocard]Mnemonic Nexus[/autocard].\r\n",

That is some cool stuff once you get the ball rolling, you can play two really massive creatures a turn.  Your opponent might counter spell one or two but eventually they will run out, and on top of that you can use creatures like the spellbreaker I just suggested to automatically trigger the second creature, that is now uncounterable because of my first one.  I imagine even a 3 mana thoctar could find some good use for this, there are a lot of nice 5/4's with an ability, and even if you use it only to get a second thoctar, you still have 2, 5/4's in play in one turn.

In red...I'd expect it to be slightly more aggressive - laying a slow creature on turn 6 isn't what red does well.

Evasion for bule (flying), defense for white (vig), aggressiveness for red (haste), and a 3/4 body because he's so tough to cast.

In the White and Blue colors I would expect some defense on this guy - some sort of shroud, or deflection ability...something useful to keep him alive.  In red...I'd expect it to be slightly more aggressive - laying a slow creature on turn 6 isn't what red does well. When I look at this card I can't find a place that he really fits...so that's why I give him 2-1/2 stars.\r\n\r\nHonestly, when I look at this card I compare him to the other R/W/U creatures out there - Lightning angel. 3 Abilities, 3 colors.  Evasion for bule (flying), defense for white (vig), aggressiveness for red (haste), and a 3/4 body because he's so tough to cast.  The reality is that Numot doesn't hold a candle to that design.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of formats - it's the only available EDH general in it's given colors....kinda sad. ",

Consider that you get to put that creature into play under your control UNTIL IT DIES.  Teneb let's you play incredibly expensive creatures for almost nothing- creatures that don't even have to be yours!",

Meanwhile you are running vamp fatties like [autocard]Lord of Lineage[/autocard] and [autocard]Vampire Nocturnus[/autocard] =)\n\nAnother example -\n\n[autocard]Rise from the Grave[/autocard] or [autocard]Ghoul Flesh[/autocard] + [autocard]Call to the Grave[/autocard]\n\nSame idea, except in zombie tribal. There are plenty of lords such as [autocard]Death Baron[/autocard] , [autocard]Cemetery Reaper[/autocard] , [autocard]Lord of the undead[/autocard] , [autocard]Undead Warchief[/autocard] , [autocard]Adaptive Automaton[/autocard] , and others that can make a deck work.\n\nThe basic idea as you can see is to stay in theme and protect your creatures while getting rid of theirs. But I digress. The classic strategy of cheating in fatties like [autocard]Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre[/autocard] and [autocard]Progenitus[/autocard] will probably always be the best strategy with Braids, she's just too good for it.

According to Wikipedia:<br /><br />&quot;Porphyry is a variety of igneous rock consisting of large-grained crystals, such as feldspar or quartz, dispersed in a fine-grained feldspathic matrix or groundmass. The larger crystals are called phenocrysts. In its non-geologic, traditional use, the term &quot;porphyry&quot; refers to the purple-red form of this stone, valued for its appearance.<br /><br />The term &quot;porphyry&quot; is from Greek and means &quot;purple&quot;. Purple was the color of royalty, and the &quot;Imperial Porphyry&quot; was a deep purple igneous rock with large crystals of plagioclase. This rock was prized for various monuments and building projects in Imperial Rome and later.<br /><br />Subsequently the name was given to igneous rocks with large crystals. Porphyritic now refers to a texture of igneous rocks. Its chief characteristic is a large difference between the size of the tiny matrix crystals and other much larger phenocrysts. Porphyries may be aphanites or phanerites, that is, the groundmass may have invisibly small crystals, like basalt, or the individual crystals of the groundmass may be easily distinguished with the eye, as in granite. Most types of igneous rocks may display some degree of porphyritic texture.&quot;<br /><br />...Porphyry is also the name of an ancient Greek philosopher famous for criticizing the early Christians, but that seems even less relevant.<br /><br />However, I think the real purpose of the name is to serve as a callback to Drop of Honey, which likewise had and obscure and weird-seeming name with no clear connection to what it did.",

In its non-geologic, traditional use, the term \"porphyry\" refers to the purple-red form of this stone, valued for its appearance.\n\nThe term \"porphyry\" is from Greek and means \"purple\". Purple was the color of royalty, and the \"Imperial Porphyry\" was a deep purple igneous rock with large crystals of plagioclase. This rock was prized for various monuments and building projects in Imperial Rome and later.\n\nSubsequently the name was given to igneous rocks with large crystals. Porphyritic now refers to a texture of igneous rocks. Its chief characteristic is a large difference between the size of the tiny matrix crystals and other much larger phenocrysts. Porphyries may be aphanites or phanerites, that is, the groundmass may have invisibly small crystals, like basalt, or the individual crystals of the groundmass may be easily distinguished with the eye, as in granite. Most types of igneous rocks may display some degree of porphyritic texture.\"\n\n...Porphyry is also the name of an ancient Greek philosopher famous for criticizing the early Christians, but that seems even less relevant.\n\nHowever, I think the real purpose of the name is to serve as a callback to Drop of Honey, which likewise had and obscure and weird-seeming name with no clear connection to what it did.",

This is now on the stack on top of the O-ring's first triggered ability.  You let the bounce resolve, removing the O-ring from the battlefield back to your hand.  This puts the O-ring's <i>second</i> triggered ability on the stack, on top of it's first.  The second therefore tries to resolve first, but WOOPSIE (cue troll-face), it can't!

Because board position is paramount and the opponent's life total relatively unimportant to a control deck, this card would only be useful in a mono-black beatdown.  And because a beatdown deck does not want to leave mana open, this is probably going to be the last card in your hand.  That means that if your opponent is also playing a fast deck, they probably won't be playing vital spells at the same time that you have mana open.  It might, however, be decent disruption to sideboard in against a control deck.  I think Duress or Thoughtseize are probably still superior, but I think this card is pretty neat and would like to try it out.",

   "text_parsed": "It's a great card.  The drawback is minimal, and it is perfect for black.  Black control decks still have to do damge, black is good at doing small amounts of damage directly and this dovetails with that strat.  It also is amazing for discard strats, since they are going to be desperate to get that spell they saved out and will pay the life.  <br /><br />In an agro deck it's amazing because you can save it for when they are about to get a spell out that will save them from your assault.  The key is to only use it in scenarios that make the choice hard for them.  Black agro is not red agro: it's more likely to go late/mid game and you need direct damage or some other way of getting in the final punch.  Of course, if you've got them down low anyway then it kicks ass.  I wou;ld use it in a casual mono-black vampire deck to help get them below 10 life.

   "text_posted": "It's a great card.  The drawback is minimal, and it is perfect for black.  Black control decks still have to do damge, black is good at doing small amounts of damage directly and this dovetails with that strat.  It also is amazing for discard strats, since they are going to be desperate to get that spell they saved out and will pay the life.  \n\nIn an agro deck it's amazing because you can save it for when they are about to get a spell out that will save them from your assault.  The key is to only use it in scenarios that make the choice hard for them.  Black agro is not red agro: it's more likely to go late/mid game and you need direct damage or some other way of getting in the final punch.  Of course, if you've got them down low anyway then it kicks ass.  I wou;ld use it in a casual mono-black vampire deck to help get them below 10 life.  As for requiring you to have untapped mana, if you are playing agro then you'll run out of cards and prolly have too much mana anyway.\n\nThat said, it does seem a bit weak in team muti-player as the opponent with the most life will counter it. \n\nStill, compared to may similar-costing blue counterspells I think the drawback is more than fair.

I'm quite sure we could discuss magic even change each others' opinions.<br /><br />How does one rate a card? To tell the truth, I find it quite easy with cards nowadays, I find most of them quite straight forward. Either its good, or its not. Older cards, seem to require more thought to them. I can't just rate this card, Scumbug is absolutely correct in saying this card is worthless (in his opinion, this card is always not a good card, in my opinion by itself, it had no value, but once again, do you value a card based on how it does, or its <i>potential</i>?).<br />Both things are good for you, either you counter what needs to be countered, OR you do massive damage for 2 mana, problem is, you will never get what you need the most but perhaps if you make both choices very hard, but to do this, you need to use a different color, and this counter is very mono/heavy black. With green, your creatures will be too big, if you counter a kills spell, they will take the life, because its much less than your creature will most likely do, if you counter a creature (of a different color) odds are it either deals with your creature (and they take the life) or it was the best they had, and they let you, so they can ignore a swing from your creature. With white, I feel its about the same. Blue, Black and Red can keep it secret from your opponents and make the choice harder to make, but Blue is NOT allowed, because if you are using blue, then use a real counter. With black, you can use this to counter an important Enchantment or Artifact, but they will just take the 5, your creatures aren't efficient, and you aren't doing a lot of direct damage, most direct damage in black, cares very little about 5 life, usually its overkill, or not enough.<br />So we are looking at a black red deck, that's the first thought I had about this card. Red is the color I ... get along with the least. I don't understand it like red mages do, but wouldn't you rather have a more efficient burn spell? 2 mana, five life, is great, but you have to do it during their turn, and most red burn is low in mana (and therefore, very mono red).<br /><br />There is no reason to use this card in most decks. Yes it can help you, but 'you' (some players, not just you) need to learn that there is always a different way to deal with things, let me give you an example.<br />Green can't kill creatures, almost ever, so when you are being milled to death by a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich Lord of Unx\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lich Lord of Unx\">Lich Lord of Unx</a> how do you deal with it?<br />I firmly believe that a player should try and play a color that suits them, you will understand the game better and have more fun. When I teach new players magic, I always explain colors to them, and let them take their time. <br />If you feel that non-green is more your color, you may have looked at the question exactly as I wrote it, with green you can't deal with it, and then you will die, but green players, and players that know the game well, know that the best way to avoid losing, is to win. Some quick calculations, some spells on the stack, win that turn.<br />Ah yes, red, you can't deal with enchantments, almost at all, putting this in your deck, you can counter it, OR get a great mana cost to damage burn on them, good right? No, you put a more solid card in.<br />In the end, I have to give this card a 1/5, it just has no reason to be played in most decks, odds are you can find a better card, or a more solid one.<br />I have to agree with Scumbug1 again about <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact Or Fiction\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fact Or Fiction\">Fact Or Fiction</a> this isn't the same thing, either you win or win more, but I wonder why he considers <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Browbeat\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Browbeat\">Browbeat</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful Quandary\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Painful Quandary\">Painful Quandary</a> bad. I have come to a conclusion about Brow, I guess I'll think more about Quan.<br />Scumbug, if you ever see this, I would like to see, in good detail, why you think those cards are horrible. I had my own opinions, but I learned that 5000 characters are the maximum anyway, I deleted it.<br />",

No, you put a more solid card in.\nIn the end, I have to give this card a 1/5, it just has no reason to be played in most decks, odds are you can find a better card, or a more solid one.\nI have to agree with Scumbug1 again about [autocard]Fact Or Fiction[/autocard] this isn't the same thing, either you win or win more, but I wonder why he considers [autocard]Browbeat[/autocard] and [autocard]Painful Quandary[/autocard] bad. I have come to a conclusion about Brow, I guess I'll think more about Quan.\nScumbug, if you ever see this, I would like to see, in good detail, why you think those cards are horrible. I had my own opinions, but I learned that 5000 characters are the maximum anyway, I deleted it.\n",

There would be no debate that that wold be a good card, with an absurd power level, broken in fact. The fact that the opponent has options does not make a card bad, it just makes it worse. Also, even if this card wasn't powerful, which you claim, it still is a good card because it has an interesting effect that makes many people happy.

Sure, this card is twice as mono-black-oriented, but that's not the point. This card is different because it's NOT blue, which is the color that specializes in getting extra turns. What's more, this costs 1 less CMC. This card is extremely good not only because black has nothing else quite like it, but also because it is cheaper and can have a seperate effect. First scenario: you get an extra turn for 1 CMC less than the blue version. Second scenario: you get your opponent to lose HALF his/her life for 2 CMC less than casting a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood Tribute\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Blood Tribute\">Blood Tribute</a> or playing/equipping a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quietus Spike\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Quietus Spike\">Quietus Spike</a>.<br /><br />2. &quot;what does getting an additional turn actually help you? You draw a card. Well, you spent a card for playing this card, so that does nothing. You untap. Ok, that's nice, if you untap more than you needed to tap to play this card.

Do you understand that you're able to play additional cards on each of these turns? Did you know that there are cards that will trigger abilities twice in a row because you now have 2 upkeeps?

If they are clever, they will choose the right thing, and this card won't help you much.&quot;<br /><br />The point of this card, at least as I see it, is not always to hope your opponents make the 'wrong' decision. Rather, it's to give your opponent a choice of two outcomes, both of which are potentially devastating to him/her. Sure, you can use it in certain situations that back your opponent into a corner to choose a certain outcome, but most of the time (at least early/mid game) it will be devastating either way. You're seeing this in black and white, where a player is either 'stupid' or not, and where there is always a 'right' and a 'wrong' decision.

I know you can attach a [autocard]Whispersilk Cloak[/autocard], if your opponent does not have the sense to [autocard]Naturalize[/autocard] the cloak and then [autocard]Doomblade[/autocard] your monster.\r\n\r\nIt's the same concept here - this would have been great, especially in Rise of the Eldrazi where aura's are plentiful, but removal keeps decks like the one this would be in from being serious in a match.",

Also, if your opponent has an important artifact or enchantment, before they play it, they can destroy the seal with their <i>own</i> naturalize or seal or whatever.<br /><br />and in any case <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=krosan grip\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"krosan grip\">krosan grip</a> is much better, and i personally would prefer some card advantage like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=mystic melting\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"mystic melting\">mystic melting</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=filigree fracture\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"filigree fracture\">filigree fracture</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=acidic slime\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"acidic slime\">acidic slime</a>.<br /><br />edit: I mean simply as far as removing artifacts/enchantments, any other synergy aside, I believe naturalize is preferable.",

It's not exactly a &quot;free&quot; brain storm, as if you're considering it a brain storm then you're giving up your normal drawn card for it.<br /><br />Magus of the Library though, as anyone who has used the actual Library of Alexandria would know, is straight up card advantage. Having 7 cards in hand is not tough - especially when you're replenishing one of those cards each turn thanks to the Magus. If you have multiples of them out, you can even activate them in response to each other. The CA this guy offers for doing nothing more than tapping him each turn is just insane. And he can even produce mana in a pinch.<br /><br />He's also easier to copy than the Library. Any copy effects like Rite of Replication or Clone can fetch you another one.

It's not exactly a \"free\" brain storm, as if you're considering it a brain storm then you're giving up your normal drawn card for it.\n\nMagus of the Library though, as anyone who has used the actual Library of Alexandria would know, is straight up card advantage. Having 7 cards in hand is not tough - especially when you're replenishing one of those cards each turn thanks to the Magus. If you have multiples of them out, you can even activate them in response to each other. The CA this guy offers for doing nothing more than tapping him each turn is just insane. And he can even produce mana in a pinch.\n\nHe's also easier to copy than the Library. Any copy effects like Rite of Replication or Clone can fetch you another one. And the more, the better! =)\n\nI've unfortunately been kept away from Library of Alexandria as we use the Legacy banned list in my casual playgroup (and rightly so), but now that I know about this guy, I'm definitely going to be making some decks to abuse his awesome power.",

(Probably it wouldn't be seen as 'pure' by anyone else, but a R/B/W creature probably doesn't care much what others think). \nDoes anyone else have an idea of what RBW would look like?",
