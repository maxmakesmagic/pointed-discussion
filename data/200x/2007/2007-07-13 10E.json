First off, he is essentially a reuseable <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=lightning bolt\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"lightning bolt\">lightning bolt</a> every turn, and if you've burned all of your opponent's creatures the previous turn you play him, he can be a reusable <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball Lightning\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ball Lightning\">Ball Lightning</a>! (without trample, oh well)<br /><br />Kamahl is awesome and has been my reliable finisher for my mono-red burn/aggro deck. However, he does have some downsides:<br /><br />#1-The 1 toughness really sucks, especially with lack of trample or first strike. It *is* very embarrassing for Kamahl, Super Barbarian Hero who fought Dominaria's greatest villains (with that huge sword and armor) to be taken down by 2 <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Little Girl\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Little Girl\">Little Girl</a>s &gt;_&lt;<br />#2-He is expensive to play, I often pray for that 6th mountain<br />#3-He is legendary, but since he screams &quot;REMOVE ME ***NOW***&quot;, having more than one in your hand is usually a good thing, and the expression on your opponent's face when you re-cast another one the next turn after he *just* burnt him is priceless, especially if your opponent is open for the 6.<br /><br />Kamahl wound be *Godlike* and easily 5-stars if he had either of the following:<br /><br />#1-First strike, like his sister, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeska\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jeska\">Jeska</a>. That's not cool that that big man's <i>sister</i> can straight up kill him in a fight. Even her <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=tap&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Tap\" align=\"absbottom\" /> ability can kill him! At least with first strike it would take fourteen <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Little Girl\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Little Girl\">Little Girl</a>s to kill him, and fifteen if he tapped one off! (How funny and sick would it be to see Kamahl chopping down a line of 14 little girls?) That seems more appropriate though...<br />#2-At least 1 extra toughness.

   "text_posted": "Kamahl is my hero! First off, he is essentially a reuseable [autocard]lightning bolt[/autocard] every turn, and if you've burned all of your opponent's creatures the previous turn you play him, he can be a reusable [autocard]Ball Lightning[/autocard]! (without trample, oh well)\n\nKamahl is awesome and has been my reliable finisher for my mono-red burn/aggro deck. However, he does have some downsides:\n\n#1-The 1 toughness really sucks, especially with lack of trample or first strike. It *is* very embarrassing for Kamahl, Super Barbarian Hero who fought Dominaria's greatest villains (with that huge sword and armor) to be taken down by 2 [autocard]Little Girl[/autocard]s >_<\n#2-He is expensive to play, I often pray for that 6th mountain\n#3-He is legendary, but since he screams \"REMOVE ME ***NOW***\", having more than one in your hand is usually a good thing, and the expression on your opponent's face when you re-cast another one the next turn after he *just* burnt him is priceless, especially if your opponent is open for the 6.\n\nKamahl wound be *Godlike* and easily 5-stars if he had either of the following:\n\n#1-First strike, like his sister, [autocard]Jeska[/autocard]. That's not cool that that big man's [i]sister[/i] can straight up kill him in a fight. Even her [T] ability can kill him! At least with first strike it would take fourteen [autocard]Little Girl[/autocard]s to kill him, and fifteen if he tapped one off! (How funny and sick would it be to see Kamahl chopping down a line of 14 little girls?) That seems more appropriate though...\n#2-At least 1 extra toughness. Then he could at least survive a freakin [autocard]hornet sting[/autocard]! (maybe he's deathly allergic, anyone think of that?)\n#3-Trample. Then at least he could suicide win you if he had to chop through some creatures for a glory attack.\n#4-Cost [1] Less. Then he can start smashing those [autocard]Wellwisher[/autocard]s a turn earlier!\n\nAnyway, I can dream all day. He is what he is. 4.5/5 stars for usefulness. And I love that art. I certainly wouldn't want him after me! And that flavor text runs chills up my spine.",

The way the rules on this read as follows:\n\n706.2. When copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the original object’s characteristics and, for an object on the stack, choices made when casting or activating it (mode, targets, the value of X, whether it was kicked, how it will affect multiple targets, and so on). \n\nThis sounds like it's saying that you get the kicked stats only if you could somehow cast clone while the other creature is still on the stack? Am I reading that correctly?",

Exactely, this is the very argument I use for the [autocard]Festering Goblin[/autocard] vs. [autocard]Carrion Feeder[/autocard] debate.\r\n\r\nAs an additional note, in many games Carrion Feeder's ability becomes much less favorable when cards such as [autocard]leyline of the void[/autocard], [autocard]wheel of sun and moon[/autocard], [autocard]Tormod's Crypt[/autocard],and [autocard]Bojuka Bog[/autocard] poke up their heads.\r\n\r\nI understand that both cards have their merits, If you are going to play mostly zombies with a high cmc that you need to be able to recover from your graveyard then [autocard]Carrion Feeder[/autocard] may be the better choice,or maybe even outside of zombies with cards like Reas-sembling Skeleton.",

   "text_parsed": "The strong, yet subtle, statement of board presence.<br /><br />I dread the thought of this game being catered to those with so short of an attention span that they deny this card because it doesn't have large numbers or flashy effects.<br /><br />Money does show itself off as the main cause of the disparity between winning players and losing players. However, it truly only applies to certain players. Those who budget like no more than $30 a year on Magic Cards (relying mostly on free extra commons) will indeed be in a disadvantaged position. But how many players does that apply to? The number is not important; I want to put attention to those players who seem to be stuck in some sort of never-win-a-game rut but manage to spend, say, at least $75 a year on Magic Cards- or more interestingly, the players hard-pressed for a win (or even a 'put up a fight') who spend as much money as any decent player does. Why are they in that position?<br />Some super-obvious reasons come to mind:<br /><br />-Just started playing<br />-Don't get to spend much time playing<br />-Very few others to play with, probably who are in a similar position<br /><br />So, what do expect from someone whom you've seen almost every Saturday at your thingy that is frequented by at least 5-8 people and lasts at least 3 hours, who has a decent amount of cards from last year's expansion and a fair amount of cards from this year's expansion? Is it still rare that that person wins a game? Does his board still not ever have any significance in a multiplayer game?<br /><br />Perhaps there is something that you, the player in fair standing observing these things, should take upon yourself to investigate and fix. Does everyone else in the group only play with legacy Elves, Goblins, or Merfolk decks? A good idea would be for you to build a deck without <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=48146\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"48146\">Vial</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159092\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"159092\">Forces</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=145969\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"145969\">Thoughtseizes</a>, or non-basic lands worth more than $5.<br />Does this player always play his <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205088\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"205088\">Doomblades</a> (or other instants/activated abilities) only during his main phases while the stack is empty?

   "text_posted": "The strong, yet subtle, statement of board presence.\n\nI dread the thought of this game being catered to those with so short of an attention span that they deny this card because it doesn't have large numbers or flashy effects.\n\nMoney does show itself off as the main cause of the disparity between winning players and losing players. However, it truly only applies to certain players. Those who budget like no more than $30 a year on Magic Cards (relying mostly on free extra commons) will indeed be in a disadvantaged position. But how many players does that apply to? The number is not important; I want to put attention to those players who seem to be stuck in some sort of never-win-a-game rut but manage to spend, say, at least $75 a year on Magic Cards- or more interestingly, the players hard-pressed for a win (or even a 'put up a fight') who spend as much money as any decent player does. Why are they in that position?\nSome super-obvious reasons come to mind:\n\n-Just started playing\n-Don't get to spend much time playing\n-Very few others to play with, probably who are in a similar position\n\nSo, what do expect from someone whom you've seen almost every Saturday at your thingy that is frequented by at least 5-8 people and lasts at least 3 hours, who has a decent amount of cards from last year's expansion and a fair amount of cards from this year's expansion? Is it still rare that that person wins a game? Does his board still not ever have any significance in a multiplayer game?\n\nPerhaps there is something that you, the player in fair standing observing these things, should take upon yourself to investigate and fix. Does everyone else in the group only play with legacy Elves, Goblins, or Merfolk decks? A good idea would be for you to build a deck without [autocard multiverseid=\"48146\"]Vial[/autocard], [autocard multiverseid=\"159092\"]Forces[/autocard], [autocard multiverseid=\"145969\"]Thoughtseizes[/autocard], or non-basic lands worth more than $5.\nDoes this player always play his [autocard multiverseid=\"205088\"]Doomblades[/autocard] (or other instants/activated abilities) only during his main phases while the stack is empty? I know of one gentle word to help fix this. \"Wait\"\nDo the other players lie about the rules and never let other people read their cards? [autocard multiverseid=\"193868\"]Lord of the Pit[/autocard] has an uncomfortable place for them... and you too if you do nothing about it. If you were upset about the M2010 rules making damage not use the stack, those sort of situations (players taking advantage of other players not grasping some rules) are to blame. I'm sure of it.",

The problem comes in when you have to decide what you would rather spend your turn doing (as ~ can be cast as early as turn 0 or 1 off of [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard]) - recurring Nameless Inversion/Fleshbag Marauder, or playing more zombies, or drawing cards (A La [autocard]Sign in Blood[/autocard] perhaps?). In the long haul however, in my experience, multiples of these guys can really help you out of your lack of a shambling army (due to [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard], etc).",

At least 3 damage is gonna go somewhere, usually more, and it's trample damage, and you're gonna gain at least 3 life, unless the damage is prevented. Still, the trample will get through more times than not, and your opponent is gonna take some damage. The net difference in life this thing makes is astounding. In 3 turns, sometimes you and your opponent can have a 30 life difference. Equip on something like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kazandu Blademaster\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kazandu Blademaster\">Kazandu Blademaster</a> or the new <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite Inquisitor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Elite Inquisitor\">Elite Inquisitor</a> and you have a 5/2 vigilant-first-striking-trampling-lifelink-annihilator causing devastation each turn, and then defending for even more life. Equip on a fatty and you can outright win the game. This also goes great with regenerating creatures since they can suicide attack or block and survive. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge Skeletons\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Drudge Skeletons\">Drudge Skeletons</a> equipped with a Loxodon Warhammer might be the deadliest thing in the game ;) The lifelink means that opponents will be discouraged from attacking if you don't attack or the equipped creature has vigilance, making this defensive in some conditions. Attacking and then equipping this on another untapped creature for defense is another effective strategy, especially if you switch off the attacker and defender as to only use <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=3&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"3\" align=\"absbottom\" /> each turn. Even equipping this to a wall is not a bad idea in some circumstances.<br /><br />This makes a removal magnet out of a 0/1 token, and suicide attacks with cheap tokens just wreaks havoc. Even if the creature dies, you will be gaining life regardless. The advantage is that since it's equipment, it can be reused if the creature dies. Giving the creature a toughness bonus or making it cheaper to cast or equip would make it broken.<br /><br />The <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=3&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"3\" align=\"absbottom\" /> to cast and equip slows down your tempo a lot, often taking up your 3rd and 4th turn moves, but getting it on a 2 drop like the blademaster is well worth it. Drawing it later in the game when you have the <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=6&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"6\" align=\"absbottom\" /> for the cast and equip can flip the game.<br /><br />This thing was a staple card back in my early days of magic. Pretty much every constructed deck my play group made had at least 2 of these bad boys in it and we were never unhappy to draw one, unless, of course, my opponent drew one, then i'd be pretty upset ;) We used to always run artifact removal JUST for this. Now we've moved on to more combo and synergy style play with too fast of a tempo for stuff like this. However, you can certainly build a very powerful deck centered around this.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of equipment, but this one can flip the game in a single turn. This is an easy 5/5 for usefulness.",

Also, imo putting a card on the bottom of a player's library is way better than putting it in their graveyard. While yes, you can use a few specific cards to prevent them from getting the cards back from the graveyard, that's an extra card in your hand/deck that isn't always helping you and that is usually giving you hand disadvantage anyway when it is, which isn't that good. A single shuffle might put a card that is on the bottom of a player's library back on top, but not that often, and many players run more cards that interact with the graveyard than they run cards that can shuffle their deck.",

Pariah is a fantastic card by itself.

Add that to the 2 dmg you've dealt to the creature already with an artillery.  Or if you like, take out two separate smaller creatures.

But what is fun is when you have that combo out and artiillery cards on the battlefield.  Congratulations, you've now turned your artillery into a 5 dmg per turn threat!  Or deal two dmg to an opponent's creature, three damage to them, and repeat it the next turn.  And you're probably not going to die so long as they can't get rid of stuffy plus pariah...<br /><br />And then there's <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=basilisk collar\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"basilisk collar\">basilisk collar</a>.  An artillery equipped with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=basilisk collar\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"basilisk collar\">basilisk collar</a> destroys a creature and the lifelink negates the damage the artillery deals to you, so you actually gain 2 life every time you use the equipped artillery.  The funny thing is that if absolutely everything goes right in the deck, a basilisk collared artillery can do 5 damage to an opponent  and gain you 5 life every turn.

Or you can play it on some creature of these that you just don't want attacking or blocking with... let's say [autocard]Woolly Thoctar[/autocard].\n\nEDIT: Sorry folks... didn't read the prior comments.",

It neither targets nor damages, so protection doesn't help.\nBut it does destroy so indestructible works, you are correct.

This guy tends to be better for getting a fat thing that you're not relying on; you just want him back.\n\nWorth noting that he's a 2/2 beater that costs only as much (total) as a regular reanimation spell! In {B}{R} with [autocard]Anger[/autocard] you can effectively replace [autocard]Rise from the Grave[/autocard] style cards (most of the time) with just him.\n\nThis guy also works well with [autocard]Order of Whiteclay[/autocard]; as he's color light, can get things the Order of Whiteclay can't, while also allowing the Order to pull him back from the grave!\n\nExample:\nSkirsdag, this guy, Order\nSac this guy to grab [autocard]Ravenous Demon[/autocard], tap skirsdag, ravenous and order for a Demon, pay {1}{W}{W} and get back your necromancer.

Time Stop doesn't stop Emrakul,<br /><br />TIME STOP <b><u>STOPS</u></b> EMRAKUL!!!!<br /><br />I think about 4 people in my playgroup went to the Rise of Eldrazi prerelease (and got a copy of Emrkul). Our entire playgroup got infected with the EDH virus. TIME STOP IS <b><u>THE</u></b> card! You just don't merely say that it stops Emrakul, you have to scream it. If I had millions of dollars, I would develop monuments and churches devoted to Time Stop (ok, not really). I don't think you all are really feeling me (just kidding), but still I must tell a story:<br /><br />You think Magic is just a game. But it goes beyond a game when you are with 8 people who began an EDH game at 10:30 PM, you look at your cell phone to realize that it is 1:45 AM, and there are 7 people still alive at atleast 32 life.

Time Stop doesn't stop Emrakul,\n\nTIME STOP [b][u]STOPS[/u][/b] EMRAKUL!!!!\n\nI think about 4 people in my playgroup went to the Rise of Eldrazi prerelease (and got a copy of Emrkul).

   "text_posted": "LMAO @NuckCHorris....that gave me quite the chuckle :-)\n\nI like this card, but the only format I'd play it in is EDH, and for that, I'd rather run Prismatic Omen.  Landwalking isn't as threatening in this format (at least not with the people I play) and it allows you to play so many other types of cards (Domain is awesome) than Joiner.  My elf deck is mono green, so I have no use for this either.\n\nNot saying it's a bad card, I can definitely see its usefulness.

Now granted, I would still prefer <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin Spellbomb\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Origin Spellbomb\">Origin Spellbomb</a> for my white cantrips, but I can still see situations where this card would be justified. Use it for Cantrips most of the time, and sometimes, <i>sometimes</i>, that one damage could be a deal breaker.",

This is probably North America's biggest online card store. Other stores might use www.ebay.com as a source for prices. ",

Back to Birds of Paradises and Llanowar Elves I suppose.\n\nI think\n\n4x Lavaborne Muse\n4x Dreamborne Muse\n4x Platinum Angel\n4x Birds of Paradise\n4x Llanowar Elves\n\n4x Worship\n4x Forced Fruition\n4x Sol Ring\n4x Wheel of Sun and Moon\n4x Fastbond\n\n20 Lands (thinking about the obvious dual lands, fetchlands and maybe even the Urza lands).\n\nEven though I think the Dreamborn will do the trick buy itself, I think it's more wicked to add the Lavaborne muse as well. There is hope yet...Muhahahaha !\n",
