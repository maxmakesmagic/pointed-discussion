Mwonvuli is more efficient in the advantage swing, but can only fetch basics, [autocard]Sapseep Forest[/autocard], [autocard]Dryad Arbor[/autocard], and original duals / shocks.  Certainly good, but won't find that [autocard]Volrath's Stronghold[/autocard] when you need it.\n\nFor those curious, the only other cards in the game that find ANY land are [autocard]Weathered Wayfarer[/autocard], [autocard]Expedition Map[/autocard], [autocard]Realms Uncharted[/autocard], [autocard]Knight of the Reliquary[/autocard], and [autocard]Scapeshift[/autocard].",

In that situation it's pretty exhilarating seeing how your opponent has to alter their usual play-mode just in order to race against the clock.\n\nAn opponent could use [c]Gremlin Mine[/c] to knock off 4 charge counters but that just makes it even more interesting.\n\nI'd say Wizards is pretty decent at balancing how many alternate win-cons there are and how they function. I personally wouldn't want tonnes of them but just the fact that a few are available here and there is really superb in my eyes.\n\nCheers\n",

Otherwise [autocard]Heartless Hidetsugu[/autocard], and myriad other generals, would be intolerable. Not that Rafiq needs help carrying games in EDH.\n\nAs for the trident, its not great. Too slow to help most infect decks or other aggro. If you had an equipment centered deck with cards like [autocard]Puresteel Paladin[/autocard], then I could see it being more of a powerhouse.

In general, i don't do counterspell, however the soul collector trick with [autocard]Daring apprentice[/autocard] is tempting.\n\nlots of applications for this lil guy, and he is totally hired. 5/5.",

Here's a walkthrough:  Materials needed: Voltaic Construct, Karn Silver Golem, Planar Portal, and any artifact that taps to add 3 to your mana pool (I'll use Thran Dynamo for this example).  First pay 1 to animate the Dynamo with Karn.  Tap Dynamo, adding 3 to your mana pool.  Use 2, untap it with Voltaic Construct, and repeat to get infinite mana.  Then, with that mana, play planar portal and search your library for any card and put it in your hand.  Now, use 1 mana to animate the portal.  Then use 2 mana to untap the portal.  Now search again, and again, until you have every card in your library (minus lands) in your hand.  How will I finish my opponent?  I'll play darksteel forge, nevinyrral's disk, and mycosynth lattice.  Now, I animate the disk for 1, untap it for 2, and pop it (pray there isn't a Return to Dust response).  Now you are unstoppable, so...use the portal to tutor for Emrakul the Aeons Torn, and play him, getting you an extra turn.  Then use the portal to tutor for High Market.  (If you want to add insult to injury, you can also tutor for It That Betrays and play it).  Now, you end the current turn.  Now, it's your turn again, and animate the dynamo to get infinite mana again.  Attack with Emrakul.  Use High Market to sacrifice Emrakul, which gains you 1 life and shuffles him back in your library.  Then use the Portal to tutor him and play him again, getting you an extra turn.  So, with Emrakul:  attack, sac, tutor, play, repeat.  End result: you get infinite mana, infinite life (from High Market), infinite turns (from Emrakul), you eventually gain control of all permanents your opponents control (using It That Betrays).  Now, lets go back: why was this possible?  Because of VOLTAIC CONSTRUCT!!!",

   "text_parsed": "@ Aaron<br />Not the best arguments. <br /><br /><i>After all, where is “mana production” in blue’s slice of the color pie?</i> <br /><br />Really? For me, there are three basic concepts in Magic. <br />First: You <b>draw</b> cards<br />Second: You need <b>mana</b> to play these cards - usually <b>creature</b> spells<br />Third: You win by reducing the <b>life</b> of other players to zero.<br /><br />Within these three points, there are four marked words - draw, mana, creature, life - and EVERY color should have access to these fundamental words AND should be able concentrate on one field.<br /><br />So if you wouldn't restrict creatures to specific colors (or specific mana costs), you should neither restrict access to mana nor to cards nor to lifepoints. The &quot;artifact&quot; way however isn't very unique and I believe WotC is missing a big opportunity by not producing flavourful in-color versions.<br /><br />So each color should have ways to play their iconic creatures, like a blue elemental or leviathan, a white angel or a black demon. And if that player wants to concentrate on these cards, he should be able to do so in-color.<br /><br />So there could be a unique way to accelerate the mana production:<br /><u>White:</u> land auras like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild Growth\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wild Growth\">Wild Growth</a><br /><u>Blue:</u> Artifical mana or search spells for non-basic lands like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient Stirrings\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ancient Stirrings\">Ancient Stirrings</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan Scrying\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sylvan Scrying\">Sylvan Scrying</a><br /><u>Black:</u> creature-based mana like a black <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves of Deep Shadow\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Elves of Deep Shadow\">Elves of Deep Shadow</a><br /><u>Red:</u> spell-based mana, faster land play<br /><br />Likewise every color should have access to card advantage<br /><u>White:</u> draw spells<br /><u>Blue:</u> Scry or seach spells for specific cards, buyback<br /><u>Black:</u> discard &amp; graveyard returnal<br /><u>Red:</u> mass destruction<br /><u>Green:</u> creature-based draw, reusable creature cards.<br /><br />And every color should have ways to gain life... and there are several ways to do so.<br /><br />@ Aaron:<br />The funny thing is that you've mentioned <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fog\">Fog</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hail of Arrows\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Hail of Arrows\">Hail of Arrows</a>. However, I believe that Fog should be neither white, green nor black, but blue. And Hail of Arrows should be neither white nor red, but the color in between =&gt; green. <br /><br />Blue should have Fog to represent a misguidance and is the most combat-avoiding color.

   "text_posted": "@ Aaron\nNot the best arguments. \n\n[i]After all, where is “mana production” in blue’s slice of the color pie?[/i] \n\nReally? For me, there are three basic concepts in Magic. \nFirst: You [b]draw[/b] cards\nSecond: You need [b]mana[/b] to play these cards - usually [b]creature[/b] spells\nThird: You win by reducing the [b]life[/b] of other players to zero.\n\nWithin these three points, there are four marked words - draw, mana, creature, life - and EVERY color should have access to these fundamental words AND should be able concentrate on one field.\n\nSo if you wouldn't restrict creatures to specific colors (or specific mana costs), you should neither restrict access to mana nor to cards nor to lifepoints. The \"artifact\" way however isn't very unique and I believe WotC is missing a big opportunity by not producing flavourful in-color versions.\n\nSo each color should have ways to play their iconic creatures, like a blue elemental or leviathan, a white angel or a black demon. And if that player wants to concentrate on these cards, he should be able to do so in-color.\n\nSo there could be a unique way to accelerate the mana production:\n[u]White:[/u] land auras like [autocard]Wild Growth[/autocard]\n[u]Blue:[/u] Artifical mana or search spells for non-basic lands like [autocard]Ancient Stirrings[/autocard] or [autocard]Sylvan Scrying[/autocard]\n[u]Black:[/u] creature-based mana like a black [autocard]Elves of Deep Shadow[/autocard]\n[u]Red:[/u] spell-based mana, faster land play\n\nLikewise every color should have access to card advantage\n[u]White:[/u] draw spells\n[u]Blue:[/u] Scry or seach spells for specific cards, buyback\n[u]Black:[/u] discard & graveyard returnal\n[u]Red:[/u] mass destruction\n[u]Green:[/u] creature-based draw, reusable creature cards.\n\nAnd every color should have ways to gain life... and there are several ways to do so.\n\n@ Aaron:\nThe funny thing is that you've mentioned [autocard]Fog[/autocard] and [autocard]Hail of Arrows[/autocard]. However, I believe that Fog should be neither white, green nor black, but blue. And Hail of Arrows should be neither white nor red, but the color in between => green. \n\nBlue should have Fog to represent a misguidance and is the most combat-avoiding color. Hail of Arrows should be green, since green is a friend of red and should therefore similar things and Hail of Arrows is restricted to combat - a thing that green values most.

For 6 mana you get 7 life and 4 cards at instant speed.[/i]\"\n\nThat reminds me of [autocard]Kiss of the Amesha[/autocard], but technically the combo costs [10]: [4] for [autocard]Well of Lost Dreams[/autocard], [2] for [autocard]Heroes' Reunion[/autocard], and [4] for the trigger. Still beats combining [autocard]Mind Spring[/autocard] and [autocard]Taste of Paradise[/autocard], the most efficient [X] cards for card-draw and life-gain, respectively, and the [autocard multiverseid=\"48993\"]Well[/autocard] is reusable on top of that.

The first is its only 7 mana if you pay it all at once, you can of course play the card on a turn where you can't yet play your big creature, but intend to equip it with the spell binder the next turn.  The second thing is its easy finding a big instant if your a red or white deck, maybe less so with other decks.  The last thing is you don't play this card to mess around and make a card advantage investment, you play it as a win condition.  I'll give you an example, play this card first, play deus of calamity for 5 mana, and then have spell binder equipped to deus with a soul's fire instant imprinted on it.  Everytime the deus deals trample damage to an opponent, you get a free soul's fire affect which gives you an instant 6 damage to target creature or player, which then also activates the deus's land destruction ability.  So, for a 2 turn set up, you get 12 damage and a land destruction every turn.  Though the mana cost is slightly prohibitive, especially for control and white weenie decks that try to reserve mana, mana acceleration decks will have no problem casting this card.  It's also an equipment card that is easier to keep in play than an enchantment card.  It may be vulnerable in some fashion, but there are no cards in the game that are invulnerable, to say never play any card because it can be removed leaves you with nothing.. \r<br />\r<br />@kiku, the affect triggers after the damage so might of oaks wouldn't actually benefit your creature, it would attack do the damage and then gain the until end of turn 7/7, which it can't use.  It would work however, if your creature had double strike, the first attack would give it the 7/7 on the second combat phase.\r<br />\r<br />Still a risky venture, certainly the equippment could be destroyed by artifact hate, but if it gets attached to a creature with the correct instant it also wins you the game.",
