At this point, you can use the three mana generated from the rings to untap Basalt Monolith again, then tap it again for another 3 mana, and then pay the ring's activation cost to copy the ability again, producing 3 more mana.

Thus, even if they say \"yes\" to answering the next question with a \"Yes\", they can say no to the concede question (because the \"abides by the answer if able\" clause is null, since they're unable to be forced to concede).\n\nThat said, this is still a great card, and creates awesome interactions between players when the effect happens. The battle of wits between the two players of which question to ask and how to slide around their answers is very flavorful.\n\nI find the best uses involve getting hidden information (\"Do you have any spells that can counter my spells in your hand?\") or forcing actions (\"Will you block my creatures?\" or \"Will you counter my next spell?\") that affect the game state.",

And I do mean infinite.<br /><br />This minigame is covered by the Gambler's Ruin Theorem, which gives a very simple formula for the probability that you will eventually reach X mana given that you currently have Y. The formula is X divided by Y. This means that, starting from <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" />, you have a 1/1,000,000 chance of being able to cast Gleemax. And a very tolerable 2/15 chance of getting Emrakul out on the second turn, though with rather a lot of flips.<br /><br />That's the formula for a fair coin. The Thumb essentially replaces that with an unfair coin (one which wins 75% of the time), which complicates the maths somewhat. But you stand to win far more than you lose. In fact, starting at <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" /> and flipping until you run out, you have a 2 in 3 chance of playing forever, actually getting <i>infinite</i> mana from this. So yes, that's a 2 in 3 chance of casting Gleemax on turn three, once you get the right cards. You're welcome.",

   "text_posted": "Someone recently asked MaRo, the Un-Rules Manager, about this on his tumblr account and he responded that this would not happen. Apparently AWOL actually creates a new zone, and like the old \"removed from the game\" that was turned to exile, it isn't \"removed from the game\" enough for the purposes of a Wish. I think it would be more fun if a wish [i]could[/i] get it, but then the point of the card - to absolutely remove the card from the game - is defeated if wishes could get them back. This also makes me think that an AWOL'd card would not be returned to a library if the game was restarted with [autocard]Karn Liberated[/autocard].",

It has a base cost of 2UU that also needs to be counted to the total. So, if you are younger than 10 years, your avatar will cost you just 2UU. If you are older than 10, but younger than 20 years, it costs 3UU. 20-30 years would cost 4UU, 30-40 years costs 5UU, and so on. So, if you are 70 or older, it will reach the 11 mana total (not at 110 years as someone pointed out). It is not clear, however, if we should count the remaining years as fractions of mana: there are cases where half-manas are used, but having to count the exact fraction would be insane: do we count fractions of years (days) proportionally as well? So, whatever it costs your avatar today, it will cost 1/3650 more mana tomorrow.
