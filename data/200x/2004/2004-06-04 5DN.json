   "text_posted": "A really cool experiment in an artifact (noncreature) finisher. Yeah, it's powerful, but so is wurmcoil engine, blightsteel colossus, myr battlesphere, and any number of other high cost finishers.\n\nWhat is so cool about this card is that it doesn't actually [i]give[/i] you anything like all the other finishers. It just creates a state on board that you have to make sure hurts your opponent more than you. A little like wrath of god or pestilence in that respect, but dialed up to 11. I agree with their decision to print it at an extremely high cost. It would have been silly in token decks or \"put cards in your hand\" decks otherwise. The thing about the other global effects printed at low mana costs is that they are either relatively easily removed or are very temporary. This is neither. ",

The idea of never having to tap out seems powerful, (after all, there was a powerful standard Faeries deck that dominated Standard because it didn't have to tap out) but the problem is that this card isn't even good in that situation as well. With smart playing, you should only be tapping out when you are doing something powerful like playing some powerful creature that will likely win you the game. This card doesn't really work well in control decks because you, ironically, have to tap out for this, and which would you rather tap out for: This card, (which, might I remind you, does absolutely nothing to help improve your actual board position,) or a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero of Bladehold\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Hero of Bladehold\">Hero of Bladehold</a>? I'd rather have the Hero. The problem is that you're using a card and tapping out for something that doesn't actually stop your opponent from killing you and actually leaves you vulnerable the turn you cast it.

This card allows the artifact ability to be countered and destroyed. All you need is one green mana opened at all times. Besides, this prevents your opponent from actually using the artifact's ability unless they want it destroyed to make a trade-off of something else-a bluff you might say.\r\nIt's a 2/2, forcing your opponent to block so they can get rid of it. In that case, now's the time to play combat tricks, saving this guy and annoying the hell out of your opponent even more.",

   "text_posted": "Using this with the Phantom creatures doesn't make a whole lot of sense, Kryptnyt.  You prevent the damage, remove a counter, then add a counter.  1 - 1 + 1 = 1.  If you remove the last counter, reducing the creature to a 0/0, he would die before you got to put the +1/+1 counter on it from Rite of Passage.  I have a Phantom deck, and there are much better ways to abuse their ability.\n\nI currently run this + [autocard]Pestilence[/autocard] in my EDH deck.  Very nice combo.  Wipes the board, and turns your creatures into absolute monsters.",

Most players have probably never even seen 4 moxes, much less have their own playset of them.  And pulling 5 specific cards in your opening hand is extremely unlikely, even if you have them in your deck.  Please don't call something overpowered simply because there is some extremely unlikely combo that could be powerful one time, assuming the stars line up perfectly that day.<br /><br />As for the usefulness of this card, no it is not a good counterspell.  However, I like the fact that it is a way to cheat in fatties in <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" />.  Seems like everyone else gets them, just not <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" />.  The usefulness of this over all of the creature-cheaters mentioned is that this one is mono-blue.  Meaning it could go in a mono-blue deck, which I love building.  And it means I could cheat out something like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkwell Leviathan\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Inkwell Leviathan\">Inkwell Leviathan</a> for about half its normal cost.  No, it's not going to lead to any turn 3 auto-win decks, but it is still a fun and useful card.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention it's an instant?  Meaning you can flash in that fattie to block on your opponent's turn?  That by itself makes this card useful.",

The other part of this card lets you cast their best sorcery or instant spell. \n\nI see this being good against, Blue, Black, and other Red decks. Most Green and White decks are more creature focused so this card tends to fizzle against them. \n\nAnd last, the art is awesome. The vulshok shaman is very beautiful and goes to show us that even Red mages can be attrative and deadly at the same time. ",

Kinda maybe, a 7/7 for WUBRG that you can put at 1/1 and remove three counters? At least its something\n\nChoose a better card for your arguments on power creep, this card was outclassed a long time ago.\n\nEdit, after reading what you say on other cards, I'm shocked, you play a modular and sunburst deck, so you are using all of your creatures to keep his one back? You must be one of those players that plays with the obvious good cards and for some reason a bunch of horrible cards in a vintage deck and complains when you lose because of your deck building 'skills'. They probably cheated.",
