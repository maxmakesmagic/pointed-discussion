I typically don’t like cards like this, meaning ones that you’d be hesitant to play outside of limited, even in a budget black “spiritcraft” deck, which is the only deck it could possibly go into. We still make narrow cards for linear limited strategies that aren’t very powerful on their own—<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden Urn\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Golden Urn\">Golden Urn</a> from <i>Scars of Mirrodin </i>leaps to mind, as an example of a card that you sometimes play in dedicated metalcraft decks, but rarely at any other time—but ideally they don’t look overcosted and have some appeal to casual deckbuilders. I could see people having fun with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden Urn\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Golden Urn\">Golden Urn</a> in a constructed deck with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket Mage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Trinket Mage\">Trinket Mage</a> and proliferate, but I can’t see any particularly happy moments coming from this Kami.\r<br />\r<br />That said, its text box went through some interesting changes during the design and development of <i>Champions of Kamigawa</i>:\r<br />\r<br />1) <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=tap&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Tap\" align=\"absbottom\" />: Target creature gains fear until end of turn.\r<br />\r<br />It started out as a <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /> 1/1 Rat Cleric with the name “Witch Doctor.”\r<br />\r<br />2) Flying\r<br />Sacrifice CARDNAME: Target creature gets +1/+1 and gains fear until end of turn.\r<br />\r<br />It quickly became a Spirit that could be used for evasion or to win a fight.\r<br />\r<br />3) Flying\r<br />Sacrifice CARDNAME: Target creature gains fear until end of turn.\r<br />\r<br />The +1/+1 was removed because it was playing too often like a green card.\r<br />\r<br />4) Flying\r<br />Whenever you play a spirit or mystic spell, target creature gains fear until end of turn.\r<br />\r<br />The set was lacking in “spiritcraft” triggers, so it was changed to this. It also went from <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /> to <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" />, remaining 1/1. Note that Arcane was called “mystic”.\r<br />\r<br />5) Flying\r<br />Attuned — Target creature gains fear until end of turn (Whenever you play a spirit or mystic spell, target creature gains fear until end of turn.)\r<br />\r<br />We tried making “spiritcraft” a keyword—“attuned”. Note that we hadn’t embraced the idea of ability words at this point in <b>Magic</b>’s history. This is a particularly atrocious attempt at a template because all the rules text is repeated in reminder text.\r<br />\r<br />6) Flying\r<br />Attuned — Target creature gains fear until end of turn (Whenever you play a spirit or mystic spell you may do the attuned effect.)\r<br />\r<br />Here’s an attempt at shortening the reminder text and making it something that could be the same on all cards.\r<br />\r<br />7) Flying\r<br />Attuned — Target creature gains fear until end of turn. (Whenever you play a spirit or Arcane spell you may do the attuned effect.)\r<br />\r<br />“Mystic” became “Arcane”.\r<br />\r<br />8) Flying\r<br />Tatari — Target creature gains fear until end of turn.

   "text_posted": "[b]Aaron’s Random Card Comment of the Day #52, 1/5/11[/b]\r\n\r\nThis card ended up in a spot that is unappealing looking, but typically necessary for limited play in a set with linear themes like Spirit/Arcane. I typically don’t like cards like this, meaning ones that you’d be hesitant to play outside of limited, even in a budget black “spiritcraft” deck, which is the only deck it could possibly go into. We still make narrow cards for linear limited strategies that aren’t very powerful on their own—[autocard]Golden Urn[/autocard] from [i]Scars of Mirrodin [/i]leaps to mind, as an example of a card that you sometimes play in dedicated metalcraft decks, but rarely at any other time—but ideally they don’t look overcosted and have some appeal to casual deckbuilders. I could see people having fun with [autocard]Golden Urn[/autocard] in a constructed deck with [autocard]Trinket Mage[/autocard] and proliferate, but I can’t see any particularly happy moments coming from this Kami.\r\n\r\nThat said, its text box went through some interesting changes during the design and development of [i]Champions of Kamigawa[/i]:\r\n\r\n1) [T]: Target creature gains fear until end of turn.\r\n\r\nIt started out as a [1B] 1/1 Rat Cleric with the name “Witch Doctor.”\r\n\r\n2) Flying\r\nSacrifice CARDNAME: Target creature gets +1/+1 and gains fear until end of turn.\r\n\r\nIt quickly became a Spirit that could be used for evasion or to win a fight.\r\n\r\n3) Flying\r\nSacrifice CARDNAME: Target creature gains fear until end of turn.\r\n\r\nThe +1/+1 was removed because it was playing too often like a green card.\r\n\r\n4) Flying\r\nWhenever you play a spirit or mystic spell, target creature gains fear until end of turn.\r\n\r\nThe set was lacking in “spiritcraft” triggers, so it was changed to this. It also went from [1B] to [2BB], remaining 1/1. Note that Arcane was called “mystic”.\r\n\r\n5) Flying\r\nAttuned — Target creature gains fear until end of turn (Whenever you play a spirit or mystic spell, target creature gains fear until end of turn.)\r\n\r\nWe tried making “spiritcraft” a keyword—“attuned”. Note that we hadn’t embraced the idea of ability words at this point in [b]Magic[/b]’s history. This is a particularly atrocious attempt at a template because all the rules text is repeated in reminder text.\r\n\r\n6) Flying\r\nAttuned — Target creature gains fear until end of turn (Whenever you play a spirit or mystic spell you may do the attuned effect.)\r\n\r\nHere’s an attempt at shortening the reminder text and making it something that could be the same on all cards.\r\n\r\n7) Flying\r\nAttuned — Target creature gains fear until end of turn. (Whenever you play a spirit or Arcane spell you may do the attuned effect.)\r\n\r\n“Mystic” became “Arcane”.\r\n\r\n8) Flying\r\nTatari — Target creature gains fear until end of turn. (Whenever you play a spirit or Arcane spell you may do the tatari effect.)\r\n\r\n“Attuned” became “tatari,” a Jápanese word meaning “curse.”\r\n\r\n9) Flying\r\nSacrifice CARDNAME: Target creature gains fear until end of turn.\r\n\r\nBack to this and [1B]? What? A late change of heart?\r\n\r\n10) Flying\r\nWhenever you play a Spirit or Arcane spell, target creature gains fear until end of turn.\r\n\r\nFinally during editing it was changed back to this ability—no keyword—and a mana cost of [2B].\r\n\r\nThat’s a lot of work on what I consider an essentially forgettable card. And this “Card of the Day” entry is quite long as well for what I consider an essentially forgettable card, so I’m out.",

It's true your out of luck if your opponent uses day of judgment or only has a shroud creature, but honestly how often does every creature have shroud, and your opponent wont want to use a board clearing spell unless they are already losing.  I also love how its a flying 5/5, so its an evasive card as well.  After shards of alara its great for those broodmate dragons too, you can block one and if it dies somehow it takes over the second dragon.",

The kitsune mystic ability does -not- specify that it has to be -your- creature.  You can steal enchantments from your opponent.  More over, this is an important difference for cards like coma veil, because you can place it on a  new target once a turn, or pacifism.  However, it is harder to get your kitsune flipped in the first place, although if you have a deck with pacifism in it you can still enchant your kitsune with it and then move it after its flipped with the ability.  Also many people don't think about the fact that its ability does not require the kitsune to tap, and when its flipped its a 4/5 creature who can do some heavy lifting.",

Note that she can bypass alot of the annoying, red, mass land destruction simply by using her ability.\n\n\"nice wildfire you got there... \"\n\nfurthermore, her own protection is partially guaranteed by her ability, so long as you don't excessively use it in order to continuously off people's permanents you should be fine, or if your deck isn't entirely based on being a complete prick so your playgroup doesn't off you at the first opportunity.\n\nHaving a decent body along with evasion also means she can win a game through commander damage, although i'd have to say it definitely helps adding in some way of amplifying that damage, just like it would with any other commander. Besides, 6cmc for an [autocard]air elemental[/autocard] with a sweet ability isn't that bad, although something like [autocard]djinn of wishes[/autocard] is also pretty neat, manages to do just fine without costing the extra mana.

Nights reach forces your opponent to discard cards, which after 2-3 turns can leave them without being able to draw anything and keep their card for more than the end of their turn.

That's just terribly arkward.\nFor that huge mana investment one should have been able to reflect it to another creature you control at least, or even prevent that damage instead - preventing damage for one mana each restricted to legendary creatures soulds at least rather useful.\nSure, just reflecting one damage rather than the entire source can be a useful combat trick, but makes protecting them from a greater source of damage very expensive.\nOverall this card is pretty much unplayable.",

Creature dependent mill suffers from some problems as an archetype in general and the Koto exemplifies this issue. Mixing creature-win stratagems and mill-win stratagems is inefficient. Note I am not saying the likes of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron Crab\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Hedron Crab\">Hedron Crab</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis of Reason\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Nemesis of Reason\">Nemesis of Reason</a> are bad. I count them as &quot;pure mill&quot; cards. I.E cards (regardless of type. Artifact, creature, whatever) that exists solely to mill someone. One would not put Hedron Crab in a beatdown deck, for instance. The Koto relies on having a large amount of creatures on the field. Using it with a crab or two would be...less-than-effective. Now here's the kicker: token makers are not mill cards, such the aforementioned <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=mycoloth\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"mycoloth\">mycoloth</a>.  As a lover of saprolings, I can tell you Mycoloth can win the game if it sticks around a turn and it will do it without the help of a Koto. Instead it punches someone in the head REALLY HARD. Damage is simply far more effective at killing someone than milling is, as one damage is 1/20th of a win while 1 mill is 1/about 50th of a win (this is why mill cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=glimpse the unthinkable\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"glimpse the unthinkable\">glimpse the unthinkable</a> tend to work with much higher numbers. It compensates for this and, consequently, makes the cards powerful even if you only cast one. It works with the rest of your deck. Complaining about them is like saying a red burn spell that hits for roughly five damage to the face for two mana is bad because you may only draw one). You are asking me to more than half the effectiveness of the killing potential of my creatures, and that is before you account for the synergies we will be skipping by going the mill route. Mycoloth synergizes with other token-friendly cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thelonite Hermit\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Thelonite Hermit\">Thelonite Hermit</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming stampede\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Overwhelming stampede\">Overwhelming stampede</a>, not with the likes of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keening stone\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Keening stone\">Keening stone</a>. I suppose what I am saying here is that damage and mill do not stack. Any card (Like this one) that relies on the other (Like mycoloth) to function is simply inefficient as you must kill an opponent in more ways than one. That said, the Koto makes an ok sideboard for turbofog-type things and is certainly interesting. I would run it in a deck with the likes of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=undead alchemist\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"undead alchemist\">undead alchemist</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona, Queen of the Fae\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Oona, Queen of the Fae\">Oona, Queen of the Fae</a> for a cool, mill swarm.

When Ryusei dies it deals 5 damage to eery creature withou flying including your own.So in the end you risk losing your own creatures as well. Red has many powerful creatures but many of them require a sacrifice. Take Rathi Dragon for example, it comes into play for 4 mana and it's a 5/5 flier but you have to sacrifice 2 Mountains to keep him otherwise he dies. It's the same with Ryusei.But do not forget that great power comes at a great cost.

   "text_posted": "Ryusei's abilities are the abilities you would acpect to find in a red card. Also they comply with an unwritten rule for red cards, that rule is RISK. When Ryusei dies it deals 5 damage to eery creature withou flying including your own.So in the end you risk losing your own creatures as well. Red has many powerful creatures but many of them require a sacrifice. Take Rathi Dragon for example, it comes into play for 4 mana and it's a 5/5 flier but you have to sacrifice 2 Mountains to keep him otherwise he dies. It's the same with Ryusei.But do not forget that great power comes at a great cost. That's the rule that will always follow many red cards. \n\nYou are right Donovan but you have misunderstood me. I didn't losing your creatures, I meant the sacrifices tha many red cards require. \nSomething like Sharpnel Blast and Rathi Dragon",

Sure, it takes a while to rev up (which, granted, pretty much takes it out of the running for any DCI-managed Legacy games), but you get this thing running into the late-game and you'll be getting a ridiculous amount of life every turn. Eventually it just reaches a point where your opponent really just can't hit you fast enough to stop your rampant lifegain. But the real kicker of all of this is that your opponent can't even Bolt your Pious Kitsune or do any other such nonsense, as for a mere three mana your Eight-and-a-Half Tales can make Pious Kitsune have protection from whatever color it is that is trying to screw with you. And after the two mana kick-up, all it takes is just one mana for each spell, so if they try to double bolt you, it's just an extra mana to stop the second one.\r<br />\r<br />So is this card incredibly narrow? Yes, yes it is. Is it also only viable in casual decks? Of course. But is it still a great card when its put into the right deck? You bet your Jace it is.

I would say this is about the same power level as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The Hive\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"The Hive\">The Hive</a>, a vanilla 2/2 is worth about a 1/1 with evasion.<br /><br />Cast for {6} - {5} for three 1/1's. When you're still comparable to The Hive, you know you're not that good. Clearly this card was not meant for an aggro format. Fortunately the Orochi are pretty much the only tribe that can come close to Elves in raw mana accel.<br /><br />Cast for {8} - {5} for four 1/1's. We're entering casual only levels here. For an initial investment the size of Akroma you get a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin Rally\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Goblin Rally\">Goblin Rally</a> with a less supported card type (granted, if you use a five-mana card in goblin tribal you are doing it terribly wrong) each turn. I imagine it gives you a pretty consistent board presence in a format like casual EDH, where 8 mana is midgame.<br /><br />Cast for {10}- {5} for five 1/1's.

The best thing to do with that is get a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conquerer's Pledge\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Conquerer's Pledge\">Conquerer's Pledge</a> each turn. Six snakes man! Six of them! Also, past here we don't gat any sorceries with the same cost and same token number.<br /><br />Cast for 14 - {5} for seven 1/1's. Hey, did you know that no card has ben printed with the mana cost of {14} colorless mana anywhere on it? We have reached the point where there are no applicable sorceries, but a Symbiotic Wurm dying has the same effect. Pretty neat.<br /><br />Cast for {16} - {5} for eight 1/1's. The closest thing we can get to this effect is <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sekki, Season's Guide\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sekki, Season's Guide\">Sekki, Season's Guide</a>, but you usually don't get that effect all at once.

There is nothing that specifically makes nine 1/1 tokens, or nine or anything, I believe. <br /><br />Cast for 20 - {5} for 10 1/1's. Yay, the number of token is now twice the cost to summon them!<br /><br />Cast for {100} - {5} for 50 1/1's. Dang, those Orochi must be getting busy. If you can't win with 50 power on the board each tun, you're probably in a position where you have 100 mana to spend. You'd have just gotten milled out in EDH, for cripes sake! Unless you just want to have a cool win-con in your infinite mana deck, why?<br /><br />Cast for {1000000} - {5} for 500,000 1/1's. Hmm, that or choosing all targets for all spells? Decisions, decisions...<br /><br />From this, I'd say that the nursery is definitely meant for mana accel and/or lategame.

Unless your opponent has mass removal and the mana to pay it, pulling this trick off will mean game over 9 times out of 10.<br /><br />Iname also allows you to play that <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karador, Ghost Chieftain\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Karador, Ghost Chieftain\">Karador, Ghost Chieftain</a> you had in your hand, as early as turn 2, and for just <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" />. This guy can then help you selectively cast all those spirits sitting in your graveyard.  This of course works best with spirits of lower CMC, but with 375 spirits in MTG, there's plenty to choose from. Your opponent's playing affinity? Cast <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kataki, War's Wage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kataki, War's Wage\">Kataki, War's Wage</a>. Your opponent's playing control or enjoys his removal spells? Look into splashing some <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" /> and including <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kira, Great Glass-Spinner\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kira, Great Glass-Spinner\">Kira, Great Glass-Spinner</a> in your deck. Otherwise, you can always go back to the old-school <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unearth\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Unearth\">Unearth</a> for those rare instances where your low CMC spirit's mana cost is a bit tricky. Similarly, you can use other reanimation cards such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Reanimate\">Reanimate</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Exhume\">Exhume</a> for the fatties (e.g. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic Guide\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Karmic Guide\">Karmic Guide</a>). Not saying <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> is a bad idea, though (with cards such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol Captain\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Drogskol Captain\">Drogskol Captain</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guiding Spirit\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Guiding Spirit\">Guiding Spirit</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist of Saint Traft\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Geist of Saint Traft\">Geist of Saint Traft</a> out there).<br /><br />This style becomes even more interesting when combined with any of the 44 &quot;Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell...&quot; spirit creatures. You could gain card advantage with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal Kirin\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Infernal Kirin\">Infernal Kirin</a>, put more lands in play with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam Dweller\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Loam Dweller\">Loam Dweller</a>, search for auras with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Tallowisp\">Tallowisp</a>, or gain life as your opponent loses it with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief of Hope\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Thief of Hope\">Thief of Hope</a>. You can even start filling the battlefield with tokens via <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baku Altar\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Baku Altar\">Baku Altar</a>.

   "text_posted": "With cards like [autocard]Bloodghast[/autocard] and [autocard]Nether Traitor[/autocard], you don't even need anything like [autocard]Living End[/autocard] or [autocard]Patriarch's Bidding[/autocard] to make [autocard]Iname, Death Aspect[/autocard]'s ability viable.\n\nThat being said, there must be something deeply satisfying about watching your 5 stars ([autocard]Jugan[/autocard], [autocard]Keiga[/autocard], [autocard]Kokusho[/autocard], [autocard]Ryusei[/autocard] and [autocard]Yosin[/autocard]), your [i]Shadowmoor[/i] block spirits (yes [autocard]Figure of Destiny[/autocard] and 5 CMC [autocard]Demigod of Revenge[/autocard] and co. spirits, I'm looking at you), your [i]Kamigawa[/i] block spirits, or your [autocard]Obzedat, Ghost Council[/autocard] and friends come out of the graveyard all at once. Unless your opponent has mass removal and the mana to pay it, pulling this trick off will mean game over 9 times out of 10.\n\nIname also allows you to play that [autocard]Karador, Ghost Chieftain[/autocard] you had in your hand, as early as turn 2, and for just [B][G][W]. This guy can then help you selectively cast all those spirits sitting in your graveyard.  This of course works best with spirits of lower CMC, but with 375 spirits in MTG, there's plenty to choose from. Your opponent's playing affinity? Cast [autocard]Kataki, War's Wage[/autocard]. Your opponent's playing control or enjoys his removal spells? Look into splashing some [U] and including [autocard]Kira, Great Glass-Spinner[/autocard] in your deck. Otherwise, you can always go back to the old-school [autocard]Unearth[/autocard] for those rare instances where your low CMC spirit's mana cost is a bit tricky. Similarly, you can use other reanimation cards such as [autocard]Reanimate[/autocard] and [autocard]Exhume[/autocard] for the fatties (e.g. [autocard]Karmic Guide[/autocard]). Not saying [U][W] is a bad idea, though (with cards such as [autocard]Drogskol Captain[/autocard], [autocard]Guiding Spirit[/autocard] and [autocard]Geist of Saint Traft[/autocard] out there).\n\nThis style becomes even more interesting when combined with any of the 44 \"Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell...\" spirit creatures. You could gain card advantage with [autocard]Infernal Kirin[/autocard], put more lands in play with [autocard]Loam Dweller[/autocard], search for auras with [autocard]Tallowisp[/autocard], or gain life as your opponent loses it with [autocard]Thief of Hope[/autocard]. You can even start filling the battlefield with tokens via [autocard]Baku Altar[/autocard]. There's plenty of cheap spirit spells capable of taking advantage of this mechanic (all the [autocard]Rusalka[/autocard]s, [autocard]Glitterfang[/autocard], [autocard]Kami of False Hope[/autocard] and [autocard]Nether Shadow[/autocard], to name a few).\n\nAll of this while you take advantage of the spirit cards in your graveyard with the [G] from the more recent [i]Innistrad[/i]. 10 spirits in the graveyard? Pay [2][G] and gain 20 life with [autocard]Gnaw to the Bone[/autocard]. 8 spirits? Cast an 8/8 [autocard]Boneyard Wurm[/autocard] for only [1][G] and double its power/toughness with [autocard]Wreath of Geists[/autocard] for just an additional [G]. 4? Get 4x 2/2 wolf creature tokens with [autocard]Kessig Cagebreakers[/autocard] every time you attack (see [autocard]Spider Spawning[/autocard] as well).\n\n[b]As you can see, the possibilities are endless.[/b]\n\n\n\n",
