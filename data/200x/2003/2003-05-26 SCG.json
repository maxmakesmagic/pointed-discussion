   "text_posted": "In casual, this works extremely well with either suspend or affinity. Basically any creature in play can net you five or more cards.

So when an opponent attacks I get to choose the creature types as well as my opponent when they control her and attack.<br /><br />Also I have an idea. is there an artifact, and preferably a cheap artifact to play that has an ability to untap a creature? Attack with Karona after casting her then then use said artifact to untap at end step. Repeat.<br />Because if you realize this, each player (or your opponents) does not gain control of her if it's untapped.<br />Is there a card like ring of gix or icy manipulator that untaps instead of tapping?<br /><br />Also is there a card to play that says &quot;attacking doesn't cause creatures you control to tap?&quot; That way other players cannot gain control of her...<br /><br />Additionally @ comment &quot;player 1: The Karona, False God that I exiled a few turns ago with Jhoira of the Ghitu resolves. I cast a kicked Rite of Replication on it, then copy the Rite twice with my level 4 Echo Mage. None of the Karonas die thanks to my Mirror Gallery.

I played it for a while before I got into magic and I found both games to have a unique charm. In magic, creativity in deckbuilding tends to be more fruitful and games are often more fairly paced (i/e outside of eternal formats there are usually very few, if any, ways to lose a game on turn 1 or 2. In YGO it can happen on a scale of rarely to all the time, depending on how bad the banlist is, and even in the best formats you can get hit for lethal damage on turn 1-2 albiet very rarely.)  On the other hand, top tier competitive YGO decks are fairly cheap in comparison to magic decks, with the most expensive decks often being close in price with the most expensive standard decks(advanced format is something like legacy or modern, where nearly every card in the game is permitted, however there are several that are restricted to 1 or 2 copies per deck.) Games can be more complex and more options are open much earlier in YGO, meaning that it is arguably more skill-intensive in regards to setup. Sets don't rotate out, which can be good or bad, depending on how much you hate certain decks, but on the other hand pretty much every card you own is legal for play at any time. If you like the idea of legacy but can't afford to play it, you would probably enjoy YGO a lot. YGO is also, in recent years, much more combo-oriented. There are few decks that just play a monster (creature) every turn and maybe drop a spell or 2 before passing, so in that respect, some Johnnies out there would probably find that they enjoy YGO also. <br /><br />TL;DR Both games have their quirks, can't compare them side by side. YGO is cheaper, has more cards that you can do things with at any given time. Magic is more deckbuilding skill-intensive and tends to have a more reasonable game state than some YGO formats and a lot more cards that are actually worth playing. Cannot compare etc. etc. come at me bros.",

Also, in a deck where mana cost matters, one might want to throw in a Manaplasm for when he plays those big fatty monsters. Another fun trick is playinga Krosan Colossus face-down and flipping it up after Ancient Ooze is declared as an attacker to give Ancient Ooze +9/+9 on an attack. With trample, that could win one the game. Another game winner especially potent with Ancient Ooze is Decree of Savagery. Whether it gets played or cycled (depending on how much mana is available) it can help push Ancient Ooze over the edge to win the game, or at least bring victory that much closer. I think it's essential though that Ooze have trample because, like Wolf-blood said, it pretty much always plays for something over twenty.",

Though Mind's Desire tells you to \"play\" the exiled cards, it still counts as [i]casting[/i] them, which in turn means that \"playing\" [autocard]Phage the Untouchable[/autocard] with Mind's Desire causes you to lose the game.\n\nRegarding the card itself, I think it's pretty busted. I've seen so many people win the game on the back of this card, and it really is one of the craziest Storm cards ever printed. I also remember great play from the Grand Prix Kobe finals two years ago where Yuuya Watanabe cast a Mind's Desire, put the storm copies on the stack and used [autocard]Remand[/autocard] to return the original Mind's Desire to his hand and draw a card, only to replay it with double the storm counts afterwards. Needless to say he won that game.",
