And each additional turn that she survives is another turn you are getting extreme value from her and pulling ahead of your opponent. Also, obviously, she draws removal or counterspells to protect or safely resolve your more important creatures. She seems at least good against aggro. Control decks would just yawn and pick combat phase every time until they get something big out. She seems kind of bad against Combo too. Really, a good player will be able to identify the most important phase for any given turn depending on instant speed spells and board position. However against aggro, they need to draw gas and they need to play dudes and they need to attack with guys, It seems good against them. I feel like one of the biggest thing this card is gonna do for you is give you a significant psychological advantage over the opponent, because they may become overwhelmed if they aren't playing excellently.  <br /><br />4/5 ",
   "text_posted": "Yes, she is quite susceptible to removal, even shock can kill her, but if they fail to kill her instant speed on your turn they are forced to suffer from her effect.

He’s a great blocker, with a lot of toughness for survivability, some power for killing off or at least deterring weenies, and Vigilance (which is otherwise rare outside of white) to let him poke each turn as well, which also makes him a great holder for a sword or other equip artifact.

He’s a classic card, and, I would argue, one of the few perfectly balanced cards.\r\n\r\nHe’s got a well-supported creature type, a supertype (artifact) that enables him to dodge a lot of black removal – such as Terror in his home plane of Dominaria or Go for the Throat in his new plane of Mirrodin – and a toughness that enables him to dodge a lot of red removal (Lightning Bolt, Incinerate, and co.) as well as enabling him to withstand a lot of your own mass removal (Infest, Pyroclasm, Slagstorm, etc.). He’s a great blocker, with a lot of toughness for survivability, some power for killing off or at least deterring weenies, and Vigilance (which is otherwise rare outside of white) to let him poke each turn as well, which also makes him a great holder for a sword or other equip artifact. Such a great card!\r\n",

If your opponent ever tries to kill it you can just use a master transmuter, or boomerang, to put it back in your hand and replay it, thus making everything you have unkillable.  \r\n\r\nThe only good thing I can say about how over powered this set was is that it rotates out of extended soon.",

While the mana cost is a bit high, the card advantage he can provide in the right deck is invaluable, especially if you're using <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal Ball\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Crystal Ball\">Crystal Ball</a> or another method of scry to sift through any unwanted cards.

[autocard]Myr Servitor[/autocard], [autocard]Myr Sire[/autocard], [autocard]Myr Retriever[/autocard], [autocard]Myr Reservoir[/autocard], this guy loves myr.",

Configuring it with other artifacts so that it doesn't counter your own spells and then configuring it back so that it counters the appropriate spells of theirs makes it insanely useful without being a mana-sink, hence the strategy.\n\nImagine their sweeper is [autocard]Pernicious Deed[/autocard], but you don't know that yet. This is on the field and so is coretapper, you [autocard]gitaxian Probe[/autocard], see that you're about to get *nailed*, and instead make it counter 3 cost spells. Now your opponent has to find a way out.\n\nSImilar things could happen with [autocard]disenchant[/autocard], [autocard]shattering spree[/autocard], and simlar. Run with Gitaxian Probe and things like Cabal Therapy to maximize it's usefulness by allowing you to continually view their hand without real tempo loss while locking them out.",

Even better is having the option to destroy your opponents' token horde instead, while leaving your big fatties on the field, if that's how you play.

However the trigger ability of the Scythe is still controlled by you, pulls back the Keiga and attach itself to it. Since the 3/3 creature loses +2/+2 due to the equipment unattached from it, it is now 3/4, causes the 5 damage on it be lethal, it is put into the graveyard. Although this damage was done by Keiga but the Keiga on the field is no longer related to it since it left the field once and come back, the ability of the Scythe doesn't trigger.",

I guess the 2/4 thing offers some flexibility in a pinch and makes this card weirder (read cooler) than if it was a 1/1 but I still am left a little baffled. ",

At least 3 damage is gonna go somewhere, usually more, and it's trample damage, and you're gonna gain at least 3 life, unless the damage is prevented. Still, the trample will get through more times than not, and your opponent is gonna take some damage. The net difference in life this thing makes is astounding. In 3 turns, sometimes you and your opponent can have a 30 life difference. Equip on something like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kazandu Blademaster\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kazandu Blademaster\">Kazandu Blademaster</a> or the new <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite Inquisitor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Elite Inquisitor\">Elite Inquisitor</a> and you have a 5/2 vigilant-first-striking-trampling-lifelink-annihilator causing devastation each turn, and then defending for even more life. Equip on a fatty and you can outright win the game. This also goes great with regenerating creatures since they can suicide attack or block and survive. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge Skeletons\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Drudge Skeletons\">Drudge Skeletons</a> equipped with a Loxodon Warhammer might be the deadliest thing in the game ;) The lifelink means that opponents will be discouraged from attacking if you don't attack or the equipped creature has vigilance, making this defensive in some conditions. Attacking and then equipping this on another untapped creature for defense is another effective strategy, especially if you switch off the attacker and defender as to only use <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=3&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"3\" align=\"absbottom\" /> each turn. Even equipping this to a wall is not a bad idea in some circumstances.<br /><br />This makes a removal magnet out of a 0/1 token, and suicide attacks with cheap tokens just wreaks havoc. Even if the creature dies, you will be gaining life regardless. The advantage is that since it's equipment, it can be reused if the creature dies. Giving the creature a toughness bonus or making it cheaper to cast or equip would make it broken.<br /><br />The <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=3&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"3\" align=\"absbottom\" /> to cast and equip slows down your tempo a lot, often taking up your 3rd and 4th turn moves, but getting it on a 2 drop like the blademaster is well worth it. Drawing it later in the game when you have the <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=6&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"6\" align=\"absbottom\" /> for the cast and equip can flip the game.<br /><br />This thing was a staple card back in my early days of magic. Pretty much every constructed deck my play group made had at least 2 of these bad boys in it and we were never unhappy to draw one, unless, of course, my opponent drew one, then i'd be pretty upset ;) We used to always run artifact removal JUST for this. Now we've moved on to more combo and synergy style play with too fast of a tempo for stuff like this. However, you can certainly build a very powerful deck centered around this.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of equipment, but this one can flip the game in a single turn. This is an easy 5/5 for usefulness.",

Attacking and then equipping this on another untapped creature for defense is another effective strategy, especially if you switch off the attacker and defender as to only use [3] each turn. Even equipping this to a wall is not a bad idea in some circumstances.\n\nThis makes a removal magnet out of a 0/1 token, and suicide attacks with cheap tokens just wreaks havoc. Even if the creature dies, you will be gaining life regardless. The advantage is that since it's equipment, it can be reused if the creature dies. Giving the creature a toughness bonus or making it cheaper to cast or equip would make it broken.\n\nThe [3] to cast and equip slows down your tempo a lot, often taking up your 3rd and 4th turn moves, but getting it on a 2 drop like the blademaster is well worth it. Drawing it later in the game when you have the [6] for the cast and equip can flip the game.\n\nThis thing was a staple card back in my early days of magic. Pretty much every constructed deck my play group made had at least 2 of these bad boys in it and we were never unhappy to draw one, unless, of course, my opponent drew one, then i'd be pretty upset ;) We used to always run artifact removal JUST for this. Now we've moved on to more combo and synergy style play with too fast of a tempo for stuff like this. However, you can certainly build a very powerful deck centered around this.\n\nI'm not a fan of equipment, but this one can flip the game in a single turn. This is an easy 5/5 for usefulness.",
