Talon Sliver and/or Fury Sliver combo very nicely with Toxin Sliver.<br /><br />If you like playing deathtouch-like abilities, I recommend building a sliver deck around this card. However, Toxin Sliver's text is not exactly equal to a card with deathtouch. The &quot;deathtouch&quot; keyword is written out as: &quot;Any amount of damage this deals to a creature is enough to destroy it.&quot; <i>Toxin Sliver</i> must deal <u>&quot;combat&quot;</u> dammage (attack dammage) to destroy creatures, whereas a card with deathtouch could be equipped with a card like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian Longbow\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Viridian Longbow\">Viridian Longbow</a> to destroy target creature by tapping. See what I mean? If an opponent plays a card that prevents you from attacking or dealing combat dammage, <i>Toxin Sliver</i> is rendered useless. That weakness is why I vote a 4 instead of 5 on this card.",
   "text_posted": "Powerful sliver card right here, I give it a 4 out of 5.\n[i]Toxin Sliver[/i] + [autocard]Talon Sliver[/autocard] + [autocard]Hunter Sliver[/autocard] = Destroy any target creatures an opponent controls, even if they are tapped (unless they have first strike or double strike), they cannot be regenerated. \nBy giving slivers first strike and provoke along with Toxin Sliver's ability, attacking slivers would kill blocking creatures before taking any combat damage from those blockers. Talon Sliver and/or Fury Sliver combo very nicely with Toxin Sliver.\n\nIf you like playing deathtouch-like abilities, I recommend building a sliver deck around this card. However, Toxin Sliver's text is not exactly equal to a card with deathtouch. The \"deathtouch\" keyword is written out as: \"Any amount of damage this deals to a creature is enough to destroy it.\" [i]Toxin Sliver[/i] must deal [u]\"combat\"[/u] dammage (attack dammage) to destroy creatures, whereas a card with deathtouch could be equipped with a card like [autocard]Viridian Longbow[/autocard] to destroy target creature by tapping. See what I mean? If an opponent plays a card that prevents you from attacking or dealing combat dammage, [i]Toxin Sliver[/i] is rendered useless. That weakness is why I vote a 4 instead of 5 on this card.",

   "text_parsed": "while the errata makes it remain basically 'just about playable' today, back in the day it was such a swingy errata change that it actually warped the Limited environment, going from a 2/2 or 3/3 much of the time to a 6/6 or 7/7 much of the time overnight, because of the many creatures to receive Human as an errata'd type. It was suggested by an old article from the period that it should be reset to only affect Soldiers. <br /><br />I think if that change had been made, it would still be a 2 or more star card today (not over 2.5), and because it's easy to find a lot of Human-Soldiers, a casual deck could still find him a home, but I don't think it was a bad enough decision to not re-errata it that it grossly negatively impacted Magic's History. <br /><br />Trivia Nerds might like to know little things like this, though. :)<br />My Vorthos side doesn't really know whether to Like or Dislike his interaction with Human-Werewolves, and ultimately decides that because there are no White Werewolves, it's odd but ok. And playing this next to <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayor of Avabruck\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mayor of Avabruck\">Mayor of Avabruck</a> is strangely pleasing since Green and White are allied colors. I admit Vorthos would be offended if a person made a Boros deck with this and Mono-Red Werewolves, and it refuses to comment on using it with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster of the Fells\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Huntmaster of the Fells\">Huntmaster of the Fells</a>, because it's torn enough to see things either way.",
   "text_posted": "while the errata makes it remain basically 'just about playable' today, back in the day it was such a swingy errata change that it actually warped the Limited environment, going from a 2/2 or 3/3 much of the time to a 6/6 or 7/7 much of the time overnight, because of the many creatures to receive Human as an errata'd type. It was suggested by an old article from the period that it should be reset to only affect Soldiers. \n\nI think if that change had been made, it would still be a 2 or more star card today (not over 2.5), and because it's easy to find a lot of Human-Soldiers, a casual deck could still find him a home, but I don't think it was a bad enough decision to not re-errata it that it grossly negatively impacted Magic's History. \n\nTrivia Nerds might like to know little things like this, though. :)\nMy Vorthos side doesn't really know whether to Like or Dislike his interaction with Human-Werewolves, and ultimately decides that because there are no White Werewolves, it's odd but ok. And playing this next to [autocard]Mayor of Avabruck[/autocard] is strangely pleasing since Green and White are allied colors.
