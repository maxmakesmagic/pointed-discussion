So mathematically if you were at -4 you would lose -2 life (aka you would gain 2 life).\n\nLooked it up and apparently when a negative life total is used for calculations it is treated as zero. So anything under 0 makes you lose 0 life, a cost you can always pay.\n\nIt works.",

If I see my opponent tapping mana for something, but they still have cards in their hand and untapped lands, I immediately think that they will cast an instant, and I should probably keep at least 3 mana open. Of course, sometimes you really need to cast a [autocard]frost titan[/autocard] or [autocard]Lorthos[/autocard], in which case I make sure I have a creature that can counter or a [autocard]force of will[/autocard]. As a blue player, I tend to tap out all my lands only under extreme circ-umstances or if I can counter without paying mana. This card may at first seem very deadly, but if you do run control blue, you should almost always be able to cast a [autocard]counterspell[/autocard].",

Just play it in a deck where you can play out as much of your hand as you want, and can either refill it quickly enough to attack when you want, or uses a non-creature win condition.\n\nFor those that are looking to combo it though, keep in mind that triggers on attack declaration, like Exalted and Battle Cry, will resolve after the attacker/s have been declared. Meaning you can get through bigger guys than you'd usually be allowed.",

I wondered if this was of any concern to the developers. Then later on Ravnica came out and two-colored decks flourished. Restrictions were still in place- I still had a hard time destroying artifacts and enchantments on the board. But still, the concept of mono-color drifted away, continued to do so in Time Spiral, even more so in Lorwyn and especially in Eventide. With Shards, there was no thought at all of mono-color (well, people still have an eye on possible red deck at all times).<br /><br />Nowadays, colors are starting to show more of their individuality somewhat- at least black is. The thing is though, that the game has changed- 'vanilla' creatures have lost power, no one plays <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45414\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"45414\">Giant Growth</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194147\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"194147\">Shatter</a> nearly as often anymore, the competitive formats have changed drastically (there were no 'Titans' in Ravnica or Kamigawa), and legacy tribal decks have <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=139702\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"139702\">way</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193651\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"193651\">too</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205108\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"205108\">much</a> support (notice that there isn't a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205082\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"205082\">relentless rats</a> that can sacrifice itself to counter a spell) (I think it is time for a one mana colorless instant that exiles target Elf, Merfolk, or Goblin). EDH has become the superior form of casual interaction. In EDH, though, mono-colored decks are difficult to roll with- especially in multiplayer. I begin to wonder if all of the mana-fixing we've gotten in recent years has corrupted us into thinking we have a right to the colors we need (at least three of them) by turn for or five. Three-color is very vulnerable to land-destruction- however, land destruction is hardly acceptable. That would've been a good edge a mono-colored deck has over three-color decks.<br /><br />Mono-color decks still have the most awesome manabases that a deck could possibly ever have- all of the lands come into play untapped, add colored mana, and they don't hurt you at all.

If your deck would have 50% creatures, then every second time you activate this card you'd get a creature into play. Which means if all those 50% of creatures do cost 8 mana, you are still not even, because you paid 4 mana in addition to play this card.\n\nIf you have a way to stack creatures on top of your library, then sure it's fine.
