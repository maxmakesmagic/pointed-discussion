Then you tell the defending players which creatures they can block with. This is great if you build up a ton of creatures, so you can make them go all out (whether or not they want to), and if they target you, they lose their creatures, and either way, unless they have vigilance, they are wiiiiiiiiiide open. <br />In single player, the real point of this is to make your stuff unblockable, remove their attack phase and/or block all their small stuff with your big stuff.<br />Of course, this would be AWESOME in a black-white deck with &quot;batwing brume.&quot; Play this against agro, play &quot;batwing brume,&quot; preventing all combat damage, and making them take 1 damage for each attacking creature. Then they are wide open (though they can play creatures on their second main phase after their combat phase,) and you attack all out with &quot;waves of aggression.&quot; Or run this in a Naya deck (white-red-green) and fog, then attack while they are open.",

This is great if you build up a ton of creatures, so you can make them go all out (whether or not they want to), and if they target you, they lose their creatures, and either way, unless they have vigilance, they are wiiiiiiiiiide open. \nIn single player, the real point of this is to make your stuff unblockable, remove their attack phase and/or block all their small stuff with your big stuff.\nOf course, this would be AWESOME in a black-white deck with \"batwing brume.\" Play this against agro, play \"batwing brume,\" preventing all combat damage, and making them take 1 damage for each attacking creature. Then they are wide open (though they can play creatures on their second main phase after their combat phase,) and you attack all out with \"waves of aggression.\" Or run this in a Naya deck (white-red-green) and fog, then attack while they are open.",

But my deck black/blue combines deck milling and revealing your hand and discarding cards, so in turn, it can ensure a win. But counters are a problem my deck sucks against--so I use Dread Return, Recover, and Raise Dead--which is good against destruction of creatures and plain out death.  Removal is of high risk and against most decks is a pretty big foe.  So take my advice and if you operate milling use x4 of Glimpse and combine your milling deck with Duress.",

But what about a multicoloured deck where either card is a potential two-drop?<br /><br /><br /><u><b>Basic Selesnya</b></u><br /><br />(Kalonian Tusker Casting Odds: 23.91%, Watchwolf Casting Odds: 52.17%)<br /><br />Let's start simple with a basic Selesnya manabase: 12 Forests and 12 Plains. Assuming your opening hand contains two lands (plus the Tusker and Wolf), here are the possibilities:<br /><br />#1 - Forest, Forest: The Tusker is castable, the Wolf is not. (Score: 1/0 for the Tusker)<br />#2 - Plains, Plains: Neither the Tusker nor the Wolf are castable. (Score: 1/0 for the Tusker)<br />#3 - Forest, Plains: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Score: 1/1 Tie)<br />#4 - Plains, Forest: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Final Score: 1/2 for the Wolf)<br /><br />It's interesting to note that the odds of scenarios #1 or #2 happening are slightly lower than the odds of scenarios #3 or #4 happening. This is because drawing your second Forest or Plains is less likely once you've already taken one of the desired lands from the deck. On the contrary, finding a Plains after your first Forest or a Forest after your first Plains is <i>more</i> likely because the unwanted land has become less common in the deck. With this in mind, the Watchwolf's chances of being castable here on Turn 2 are actually slightly higher than the 50% &quot;coin toss&quot; chance that you might expect.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>Dual Selesnya</b></u><br /><br />(Kalonian Tusker Casting Odds: 42.63%, Watchwolf Casting Odds: 79.29%)<br /><br />Now let's try a more developed manabase: 8 Forests, 8 Plains, 8 <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253681\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"253681\">Temple Gardens</a>. Assuming that having 8 Temple Gardens is even legal here, and that your opening hand contains two lands (plus the Tusker and Wolf), here are the possibilities:<br /><br />#1 - Forest, Forest: The Tusker is castable, the Wolf is not. (Score: 1/0 for the Tusker)<br />#2 - Plains, Plains: Neither the Tusker nor the Wolf are castable. (Score: 1/0 for the Tusker)<br />#3 - Temple Garden, Temple Garden: Both the Tusker and the Wolf are castable. (Score: 2/1 for the Tusker)<br />#4 - Forest, Plains: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Score: 2/2 Tie)<br />#5 - Plains, Forest: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Score: 2/3 for the Wolf)<br />#6 - Forest, Temple Garden: Both the Tusker and the Wolf are castable. (Score: 3/4 for the Wolf)<br />#7 - Temple Garden, Forest: Both the Tusker and the Wolf are castable. (Score: 4/5 for the Wolf)<br />#8 - Plains, Temple Garden: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Score: 4/6 for the Wolf)<br />#9 - Temple Garden, Plains: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Final Score: 4/7 for the Wolf)<br /><br />Like in the Basic Selesnya example above, the Wolf gets a slight probability advantage over the Tusker due to the inherent difficulty associated with drawing multiples of a desired card. On top of this, it is very clear that the Wolf gathers more of an advantage from the use of dual lands than the Tusker does here.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>TL;DR</b></u><br /><br />If you're using a nonwhite deck or Beast Tribal or just something <i>very</i> green-heavy, go with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian Tusker\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kalonian Tusker\">Kalonian Tusker</a>.

Since Mycoloth creates Saprolings during the upkeep, rather than as the effect of removing spore counters, the first Mycoloth can create however many Saprolings, then the new copy of Mycoloth can devour them, repeating the process next turn.\n\nIn one game, my opponent made the mistake of playing a [autocard]Wall of Reverence[/autocard]. I already had a Mycoloth enchanted with Followed Footsteps, so I played another Followed Footsteps on his wall, and began gaining life ridiculously fast.\n\nIt's definitely a fun card to play, with lots of possibilities.",

[autocard]Back to Nature[/autocard] deals with Asceticism, Sterling Grove and Indestructibility, then [autocard]Doom Blade[/autocard] to Phytohydra. That setup is also still vulnerable to mill, life loss effects, and alternate win condition effects. To get a real lock, instead of all the indestructibility/shroud stuff you've got there try [autocard]Leonin Abunas[/autocard], [autocard]Mycosynth Lattice[/autocard], and [autocard]Darksteel Forge[/autocard], plus [autocard]Platinum Angel[/autocard]. At that point you don't really need Phytohydra or the shield anymore, and you're still vulnerable to some forms of ma[]ss removal like [autocard]Final Judgment[/autocard] or [autocard]Black Sun's Zenith[/autocard].",

Solid P/T for its cost, but more importantly, INSANE CARD ADVANTAGE, and in exchange for a resource that black has no problem using.<br />  If you think about it, the life loss is virtually negligible. Let's say the average converted mana cost of the non-land cards in a 60-card deck is 3.333. In a deck with 24 lands, thats an average CMC of 2 and therefore the typical amount of life you lose each upkeep with this guy on your side, especially when he's swinging for 2.<br /><br /> <b>For those that doubt this claim, consider the following model</b>: You and your opponent are playing a game, in which any turn he or she has at least two cards in hand during his or her precombat main, plays one land and casts one spell. If he or she has one card during this precombat main, he or she has either a land drop or a spell. For the sake of this exercise, we will assume that on even turns a land is drawn and on odd turns a spell is drawn once we get to topdecking.

   "text_posted": "  I would put this card in the Top 5 creature cards of all time, and definitely the best black creature ever. Solid P/T for its cost, but more importantly, INSANE CARD ADVANTAGE, and in exchange for a resource that black has no problem using.\n  If you think about it, the life loss is virtually negligible. Let's say the average converted mana cost of the non-land cards in a 60-card deck is 3.333. In a deck with 24 lands, thats an average CMC of 2 and therefore the typical amount of life you lose each upkeep with this guy on your side, especially when he's swinging for 2.\n\n [b]For those that doubt this claim, consider the following model[/b]: You and your opponent are playing a game, in which any turn he or she has at least two cards in hand during his or her precombat main, plays one land and casts one spell. If he or she has one card during this precombat main, he or she has either a land drop or a spell. For the sake of this exercise, we will assume that on even turns a land is drawn and on odd turns a spell is drawn once we get to topdecking. Each spell that's drawn by each player is an answer to the spell played the opponent the turn before, with the exception of Dark Confidant. On turns where a player played only a land, the player who still has cards in hand will be able to cast a spell unanswered with life value of a single [autocard]Shock[/autocard] on his or her next turn.

   "text_parsed": "DavidLopes, this is for you, my friend. Also for littleteapot, short and stout. And maybe Zulp, you seem confused.\r<br />\r<br />When you first cast a spell (of the instant and sorcery variety) with this in play, it gets exiled. That's step one. Imagine it floating around in this big swirly storm (a big ball of timey-wimey stuff, if you will). Now, right away, you get a copy of that spell you just played! For free! Isn't that nice? So it's sort of like if you just played it straight up. \r<br />\r<br />The fun starts when you start casting more spells, though. The second spell you play gets- guess what-exiled. It's now floating around up there with the first spell. Then, you get to cast the first spell again, for free! And then, you get to cast the second spell! For free! \r<br />\r<br />I think you can see where this is going. Eventually, you'll have stored up quite a stockpile of cards out \r<br />there, and assuming some of them are burn- or, say, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time Stretch\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Time Stretch\">Time Stretch</a> (or, for a lesser punch, you can do the Time Warp again) it's pretty much game. Assuming you've been keeping your opponenet from doing much of anything.\r<br />\r<br />But you wanted more specifics. Patience.\r<br />\r<br />Here's an example to clarify littleteapot's thing, and to solidify your understanding of the card's interactions.\r<br />\r<br />Turn Eight (yes, this turn exists, Spike). I cast this and follow up with a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning Bolt\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lightning Bolt\">Lightning Bolt</a> (as if it needed to be autocarded). The bolt gets exiled before it can do anything, then copied. I make the copy do 3 damage to your face. Your face has been harmed. \r<br />Eye Count: Bolt.\r<br />\r<br />Turn Eight (you). You are up.

   "text_posted": "DavidLopes, this is for you, my friend. Also for littleteapot, short and stout. And maybe Zulp, you seem confused.\r\n\r\nWhen you first cast a spell (of the instant and sorcery variety) with this in play, it gets exiled. That's step one. Imagine it floating around in this big swirly storm (a big ball of timey-wimey stuff, if you will). Now, right away, you get a copy of that spell you just played! For free! Isn't that nice? So it's sort of like if you just played it straight up. \r\n\r\nThe fun starts when you start casting more spells, though. The second spell you play gets- guess what-exiled. It's now floating around up there with the first spell. Then, you get to cast the first spell again, for free! And then, you get to cast the second spell! For free! \r\n\r\nI think you can see where this is going. Eventually, you'll have stored up quite a stockpile of cards out \r\nthere, and assuming some of them are burn- or, say, [autocard]Time Stretch[/autocard] (or, for a lesser punch, you can do the Time Warp again) it's pretty much game. Assuming you've been keeping your opponenet from doing much of anything.\r\n\r\nBut you wanted more specifics. Patience.\r\n\r\nHere's an example to clarify littleteapot's thing, and to solidify your understanding of the card's interactions.\r\n\r\nTurn Eight (yes, this turn exists, Spike). I cast this and follow up with a [autocard]Lightning Bolt[/autocard] (as if it needed to be autocarded). The bolt gets exiled before it can do anything, then copied. I make the copy do 3 damage to your face. Your face has been harmed. \r\nEye Count: Bolt.\r\n\r\nTurn Eight (you). You are up. You, wanting in on this action, cast a [autocard]Forsee[/autocard]. It gets exiled, added to our Eye Count. Then, you can cast the two spells that are in the storm as you see fit. You choose to bolt MY face first, then cast your Forsee copy. \r\nEye count: Bolt, Forsee.\r\n\r\nTurn Nine. I figure this is enough tomfoolery, and I cast myself up a [autocard]Cruel Ultimatum[/autocard]. It's about to hop aboard the exile train, but you say stop! Don't get on that train!

It works similarly to the &quot;Burning wish&quot; combo but it runs a lot more smoothly as a black/blue deck thanks to cards like tutor and the black &quot;Increasing&quot; card from Dark Ascension that does the same thing.  Basicly you play &quot;eye of the storm&quot; first then you need to play &quot;bump in the night&quot; and &quot;runic repetition&quot; eye of the Storm will exile Bump in the night when it is cast and then put a copy on the stack, then runic repetition gets the copy of bump in the night back for you but you still exiled a copy so a copy of bump in the night still gets added to the stack. (Eye says copy every spell exiled with eye of the storm it doesn't say the spell still has to be exiled in order to copy it) then you can play Bump in the night (which only costs a single black mana and causes an opponent to lose 3 life) as many times as you have the mana for, increasing the number of copies on the stack with every play.  Then if you play dark ritual the combo becomes an infinite loop with ritual being repeatedly cast to give you all the black mana you could ever need and then some. Probably the best part of this combo is that all you really need to get it started it eye of the storm and tutor.  Since tutor goes and gets all the other pieces of the combo for you playing tutor with eye of the storm in play is an instant win in almost every situation. (basicly you can tutor for bump in the night for example then when you play Bump it recasts tutor, then you can go get ritual or Repetition, whichever the situation calls for after that you can go get other cards you might want like &quot;<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory's Journey\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Memory's Journey\">Memory's Journey</a>&quot; which can help save your Eye of the storm after someone has destroyed it.)  I have played this in both multiplayer and one on one and have won with it.  For creatures just in case you were wondering I don't play with any creature spells in the deck I use &quot;<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moan of the unhallowed\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Moan of the unhallowed\">Moan of the unhallowed</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap the Seagraf\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Reap the Seagraf\">Reap the Seagraf</a>&quot; to put zombies into play which will usually buy me the time to get an eye into play and of course they work pretty well with the combo I outlined earlier.

If a player can't even hunt for a card they need, you keep them from going off for a few more turns, buying you the time to mill the card they want so they cant get it anyway. <br /><br />As for rarity, yeah it should've been uncommon for the set as there wasn't THAT much tutor at the time.<br /><br />I run 4 of these in a mono black discard deck.

   "text_posted": "This is Dimir because anyone who really knows how a good mill deck should work knows that mill's version of control is denying your opponent key cards they need to draw/play (hence why mill often combos with discard/counter).  If a player can't even hunt for a card they need, you keep them from going off for a few more turns, buying you the time to mill the card they want so they cant get it anyway. \n\nAs for rarity, yeah it should've been uncommon for the set as there wasn't THAT much tutor at the time.\n\nI run 4 of these in a mono black discard deck.

Red and white are really starved for solid repeatable draw effects, and Bloodletter Quill's relatively cheap casting and activation costs  would make it a much more appealing alternative to many artifacts that make you feel kinda bad for using them ([autocard]Jayemdae Tome[/autocard], [autocard]Candles of Leng[/autocard], [autocard]Book of Rass[/autocard], [autocard]Tower of Fortunes[/autocard], ect). These cards show up in decks from time to time, but I'm sure they'd be replaced with Bloodletter Quill if they were able to do so.\r\n\r\nBut blue and black are not so limited in there card advantage engines, and never need to bother with the dregs of the artifact tomes. Why would a blue & black deck ever play the Quill over [autocard]Necropotence[/autocard] or [autocard]Phyrexian Arena[/autocard]? Limiting the card to colors with better alternatives killed it. ",

So he finally settled and just used two of each lol.\n\nIt IS extremely annoying that this can't fetch forests.  I would've given this card a straight up 10/10 if it could.",

If they don't block you can just play a spell and then pump however much is left over. This allows you to maintain tempo, have a nigh-unblockable creature, or be generating a lot of card advantage by a wary opponent.\n\n",

You can use it in so many ways.<br /><br />You could use it to get as much land in play as you want, from something like an Explore, because you put on bottom a hand of mostly non-land and grab a hand with a random sample of land.  Then, you play whatever draw spell your deck gave you, if any, and look at a new hand.  You can also cycle through your deck looking for all your Rav Bounce lands, playing tons of land and generating card advantage.

I looked it up: literally it says: &quot;return target creature card from graveyard to play.&quot; Russian not only lacks definite and indefinite articles ('a' and 'the') but often omits other modifiers and adjectives as well, with the meaning derivable from context. I think the 'your' is implied in that sentence, but obviously it should be worded more clearly.<br /><br />On another note, I'd hate to be the guy whose job it is to translate cards into Russian. Well not really, obviously I'd love to work for Wizards, but the rules and effects are so awkwardly worded and so much of the flavor is lost. I wonder if seems as weird to non-English-speaking Russian players. This card is a perfect example - there is simply no way to translate the pun, so the Russian name reads something like &quot;Rotten Hardening&quot;. Ugh. I wish they were a little less literal with the translations and at least tried to make the cards sound cool in the target language.",

I think the 'your' is implied in that sentence, but obviously it should be worded more clearly.\n\nOn another note, I'd hate to be the guy whose job it is to translate cards into Russian. Well not really, obviously I'd love to work for Wizards, but the rules and effects are so awkwardly worded and so much of the flavor is lost. I wonder if seems as weird to non-English-speaking Russian players. This card is a perfect example - there is simply no way to translate the pun, so the Russian name reads something like \"Rotten Hardening\". Ugh. I wish they were a little less literal with the translations and at least tried to make the cards sound cool in the target language.",

All in all, I've never encountered a situation where I wouldn't rather have a [autocard]Gleancrawler[/autocard] out, and that has a less restrictive mana cost with an awesome static ability.",

   "text_posted": "I had to do a double take when I first saw one of these lying around... Let's see... A 5/5 for 4BB. Okay, it had better be useful. Sac a creature when it comes into play... Oh, boy... this thing had better have some amazing abilities! Can't be blocked by Saprolings... HUH?!?!?! Shouldn't it have Fear or something to justify the name and the absurd cost?!\r\n\r\nI have no idea what they were on when they made this card? A 5/5 for 4BB that can't be blocked by Saprolings is basically a Craw Wurm - why does it need to sac a creature, too? And who cares about Saprolings? And isn't a 5/5 large enough to handle Saprolings that are almost always 1/1's? And how does this card make any sense at all? Plants fleeing the angry mob? A mob that wants to hunt down plants?

Balefire liege especially makes her scary, because casting her and attacking with her means 11 damage, 3 life gained, and your opponents have to contend with a flying 8/5 that can redirect 3 points of damage.<br /><br />I think that it's important to mention that she works great with one of my favorite cards, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=shining shoal\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"shining shoal\">shining shoal</a>. Having those two in my hand in the early part of the game lets me sigh with relief. If I get the chance/have to redirect 8 points of damage (typically as a complete surprise to my opponent since I'm not using any mana), that's usually game over or very near to it.

At 8 mana, she doesn't really get to take part in most of the game, meaning she's better off being forgotten and overlooked until it's time to win. The majority of my strategy until then is to wait until I get the right cards in hand while keeping my opponent's board in check, completely ignoring anything that increases their life. It's amazing how secure people feel when they have 60+ life, even though they still die from just 21 points of combat damage from a general.

It's an odd strategy, but it keeps working for me, and it always feels good to send an angel with a fiery sword to cut down a person who thinks they are invincible.<br /><br />I don't think I've mentioned just how awesome the card alone is. Great art, a great mix of abilities that synergize well with each other (including my two favorites, flying and haste, as well as a powerful unique ability with multiple applications), and a solid 6 power. Though not the strongest card in the world, she's powerful, impressive, and really feels like the general of an army, even when you're not playing EDH.",

With a [autocard]scourge of the nobilis[/autocard] or a [autocard]sunforger[/autocard], Razia deals that damage fairly quickly. It's an odd strategy, but it keeps working for me, and it always feels good to send an angel with a fiery sword to cut down a person who thinks they are invincible.\n\nI don't think I've mentioned just how awesome the card alone is. Great art, a great mix of abilities that synergize well with each other (including my two favorites, flying and haste, as well as a powerful unique ability with multiple applications), and a solid 6 power. Though not the strongest card in the world, she's powerful, impressive, and really feels like the general of an army, even when you're not playing EDH.",

Trust me, you don't want to draw 2-3 5 mana cards in your opening hand if you're playing aggro, and you want to avoid mulligans if at all possible. I wouldn't devote more than 4 slots for 5 mana cards in an aggro deck, if even that. Agrus is great, and prior to the Liege, he probably was the best card for R/W decks out there. Though he does shine if you can do more than one attack in a turn. (+2/+2 on first attack, +4/+4 on second)",

Trust me, you don't want to draw 2-3 5 mana cards in your opening hand if you're playing aggro, and you want to avoid mulligans if at all possible. I wouldn't devote more than 4 slots for 5 mana cards in an aggro deck, if even that. Agrus is great, and prior to the Liege, he probably was the best card for R/W decks out there. Though he does shine if you can do more than one attack in a turn. (+2/+2 on first attack, +4/+4 on second)",

First of all, it is a black enchantment that reduces noncreature spells only by 2 mana. Most of black's noncreature spells are instants or sorceries that are either some variant of destroying a nonblack creature or forcing your opponent to discard a card.

   "text_posted": "\n\n@savagebrain\n\nLet me tell you why this card is bad, because you are apparently quite the \"simpleton\" yourself. First of all, it is a black enchantment that reduces noncreature spells only by 2 mana. Most of black's noncreature spells are instants or sorceries that are either some variant of destroying a nonblack creature or forcing your opponent to discard a card. The kill spells average at around 3 mana- and I really wouldn't want to sacrifice a creature just to shave off one mana from [autocard]terror[/autocard]. That leaves the discard spells and the best of those don't get reduced [i]at all[/i]- [autocard]duress[/autocard] and [autocard]thoughtseize[/autocard] both cost {B} and hymn to tourach cost {B}{B}. The amount of mana shaved off is really not worth sacrificing a creature.\n\nNow, there are also much better ways to sacrifice creature tokens. [autocard]Bone splinters[/autocard], [autocard]fleshbag marauder[/autocard], [autocard]innocent blood[/autocard] and [autocard]barter in blood[/autocard] are all so good on their own you hardly need gravepact (and certainly not savra- she's just a strictly worse legendary creature version of gravepact at best). \n\nWhat makes this card horrible is you [i]have[/i] to sacrifice a creature to play [i]any[/i] noncreature spell, or otherwise [i]counter it entirely[/i].

You play a Serra Angel and pass the turn. You have a First strike creature, and a flying vigilance creature in play.<br /><br />After your opponent's upkeep, Both your creatures have First Strike, Protection from black, Flying, and Vigilance. Your opponent throws a pair of lightning bolts at the Serra.

   "text_posted": "@telecaster: i'm a bit confused about this card. does this mean that its abilities also are in effect in my opponents upkeep?\n\nSay on your turn you have a White Knight and Concerted effort in play. You play a Serra Angel and pass the turn. You have a First strike creature, and a flying vigilance creature in play.\n\nAfter your opponent's upkeep, Both your creatures have First Strike, Protection from black, Flying, and Vigilance. Your opponent throws a pair of lightning bolts at the Serra. The knight is still first strike, pro black, vigilant, and flying until end of turn. \n\nThe next upkeep (whether yours or a third player's in the game), your knight doesn't get flying and vigilance again, since the angel's dead.\n\n The list of shared abilities only get updated during everyone's upkeep. creatures you play in your turn don't get them (since they weren't on the field during upkeep when Concerted Effort's ability triggered).

I wasn't going there. I cares about my relaxing Saturday evenings with other esteemed fellows playing Magic. The deck has no flavor, it just wins; so many people can't have a preference for it. Yet so many people play it, no ideas in the deck originated from any of them. They're mindlessly going through some motions; it gets old; I might as well be going to a Catholic Mas$.<br /><br />So, regarding my original point, notice how many <i>different</i> nonland cards there are in the decklist. Ten (10), yes. Dare you even play a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=183063\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"183063\">Vectis Agents</a> (the dumbest blue-black card I can think of right now) and remove two non-land cards, their deck will begin to SUCK. I know, I know, they'll remove the SOB before you can do anything. It's not hard to get the cards to protect his (behind). Run 4 of him (even though they don't see each other's removals) because they <i>have</i> to kill it.<br /><br />I like how this dude is only good against stick-up-the-butt competitive decks and not the run-of-the-mill casual decks.

Let's look at a deck list:\n\n4 Putrid Leech, 4 Sprouting Thrinax, 4 Bloodbraid Elf, 3 Broodmate Dragon, 4 Bolts, 4 Blightnings, 4 Pulses, 2 Terminates, 3 Garruk, 3 Bituminous Blasts\n\nFor those who don't know or who read this much later this is a competive 'Jund' standard deck with Shards of Alara, M2010, and Zendikar.\nI know, Circu was out of standard like 4 years before this. I wasn't going there. I cares about my relaxing Saturday evenings with other esteemed fellows playing Magic. The deck has no flavor, it just wins; so many people can't have a preference for it. Yet so many people play it, no ideas in the deck originated from any of them. They're mindlessly going through some motions; it gets old; I might as well be going to a Catholic Mas$.\n\nSo, regarding my original point, notice how many [i]different[/i] nonland cards there are in the decklist. Ten (10), yes. Dare you even play a [autocard multiverseid=\"183063\"]Vectis Agents[/autocard] (the dumbest blue-black card I can think of right now) and remove two non-land cards, their deck will begin to SUCK. I know, I know, they'll remove the SOB before you can do anything. It's not hard to get the cards to protect his (behind). Run 4 of him (even though they don't see each other's removals) because they [i]have[/i] to kill it.\n\nI like how this dude is only good against stick-up-the-butt competitive decks and not the run-of-the-mill casual decks. Unfortunately, he is too expensive and slow against tribal-aggro decks.",
