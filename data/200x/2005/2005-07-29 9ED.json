In light of the hefty 3 [u][b]black[/b][/u] mana required to cast it, Grave Pact is a rather difficult card to splash. Because having more than one in your hand equates to a dead card, Grave Pact makes my list of [b]superb[/b] \"one of's\". Since you will be already running black, I recommend [autocard]Demonic Tutor[/autocard] and [autocard]Vampiric Tutor[/autocard] to make it [i]seem[/i] like you are running three in your deck. If you are on a budget, [autocard]Diabolic Tutor[/autocard] will suffice. In my favorite casual [b]black[/b]/[b]red[/b] goblin deck, I run 1 Grave Pact along with... 4 [autocard]Mogg War Marshal[/autocard], 2 [autocard]Goblin Chirurgeon[/autocard], 2 [autocard]Skirk Prospector[/autocard], and 1 [autocard]Tuktuk the Explorer[/autocard] to ensure fodder plus an instance speed [b]FREE[/b] sac. engine. I also run 1 [autocard]Goblin Warrens[/autocard] to 99% ensure an opponent will [i]NOT[/i] have a creature on the board! A [autocard]Phyrexian Tower[/autocard] also works well to supply the sacrifice engine and [b]black[/b] mana needed. On a side note, the artwork for the 8th edition version is fantastic. Check it out!

[autocard]Clock of Omens[/autocard] can do it by tapping itself and Howling Mine, then untapping itself or a third artifact you may want to use again, like any number of numerous mana rocks. That's your best option. But if you really need more, [autocard]Blinkmoth Well[/autocard] actually has a use with Howling Mine, and [autocard]Lodestone Myr[/autocard] gets a tremendous +1/+1 by tapping the mine!

In fact, The pattern of 2^1 and 2^2 and so on seems to indicte the simulation is just taking the number of players and putting it to the xth power where x is the amount of coinflips, so it seems like a rather silly simulation to me. Maybe I am missing something you could enlighten me on? And with 8 flips chances are you aren't going to take any damage at all, because the chances are that if you flip a coin 8 times you are going to hit one heads and then use The thumbs other effect to cancel out all the rest of the flips<br /><br />And dont ever build a deck with this to win, if you do, you are completely missing the point.

   "text_posted": "@Totema.\n[autocard]Fog Bank[/autocard] states \"combat damage.\"  So if I attack you, and you block with Fog Bank.  No matter the Power of my creature, it would not deal damage to your creature.  Since Fog Bank has 0 Power as default without any buffs, and stated that it deals no damage by it's own affect, it would deal no damage to my creature.  Both would be safe from this enchantment.  However, if I casted [autocard]Tremor[/autocard], again your creature would be safe.  It's non-combat damage, but it does only affect non-flying creatures.  Any non-flying creature on the field would die from this affect, unless prevented per card allowance, or indestructible, or etc.  Later I have [autocard]Blood Cultist[/autocard], using it's [T] ability and dealt 1 damage to Fog Bank.  This is not combat damage, and would strike your creature.  Fog Bank would only take 1 damage, not lethal damage since has Toughness 2.  Death Pits of Rath would check and see that Fog Bank did take damage, and then destroy it.  Thus giving my Blood Cultist a +1/+1 counter.",

There was some serious-sounding hyperventilative discussion of whether it would ever be sane to play any other color. \"Alliances broke blue\" is the sort of thing people would say, as well as \"Force of Will makes any random blue card better than every other card in the game.\" Stuff like that.\n\nIn response to that, people would jokingly assert that Storm Crow must be the most broken card ever, because it was blue and printed in Alliances. This made all the more sense because of the flavor text (you can read \"the worst\" as \"the worst card ever\" literally or as \"the most devastating card ever\" playfully).\n\nMost players who make Storm Crow jokes nowadays aren't aware of the history of this tradition, but hey, it's great fun to see people get so much amusement out of such a mediocre card. And I like the jokes about the new reprint flavor text better anyhow. Storm Crow returning, we'd best get to burning! :)\"",

That whole Karona nonsense is widely regarded as a huge mistake in continuity between different authors not informed of each others' work. \r\n\r\n@ Shadoflaam: In this article from the address below, Doug flat out states he's dead. \r\n\r\n[i]\"The role of the leader of Phyrexia, formerly occupied by Yawgmoth. After Yawgmoth's death, Phyrexia was defeated on Dominaria. At this time, the civilization of Phyrexia on Mirrodin has not found a new Father of Machines.\"[/i]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/109\r\n\r\nWhile this doesn't absolutely guarantee that they wouldn't pull some shenanigans like you mentioned (though I ran a quick search at Wizards' homepage, but didn't find anything for that phrase you used) I think this statement is the best source to go off of until it's official that Yawgmoth is alive in some capacity.\r\n\r\n",
