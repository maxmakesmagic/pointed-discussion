If only playing one mana per turn and those two equipments, that's +12+12 not taking in however many of this you have exactly on turn 4. A maximum of 18/14, plus it is hard to get that hand, but still a decent combo.",

Works best when you block with the ants, and then flash in Blessing of Leeches to preserve the ants while still getting your tokens =)\n\n[autocard]Spitemare[/autocard] / [autocard]Boros Reckoner[/autocard] = damage reflection. The best part is that you can block whatever you want now that they can regenerate for free!\n\n[autocard]Nested Ghoul[/autocard] = more tokens on the field. The nested ghoul can keep taking punishment now that it has free regeneration, netting you a 2/2 zombie creature everytime!\n\nNow when you consider that you can add in [autocard]Fire Ants[/autocard] or [autocard]arena[/autocard] to set off the damage trigger to these creatures whenever you want, things become more interesting. Even simpler methods can use [autocard]whipflare[/autocard] or [autocard]pyroclasm[/autocard]. Blessing of Leeches enables these cards to become even more powerful, because their default power/toughness was originally meant to limit what they could block and still stay on the field. Leeches eliminates that drawback in a very nice way.",

The ability will counter anything you try to do to creatures as well.\r\n\r\nSince my deck is somewhat instant/sorcery heavy (what blue deck wouldn't be), I decided to run [autocard]Runechanter's Pike[/autocard]. The other day I targeted Kira with the Pike, and it gets countered the first time, I equipped it again and it stayed, this however allowed my opponent to tap Kira before my attack phase. That bought him a turn, but it's something I was well aware could happen, and it was worth the risk.\r\n\r\nHe was playing a mono white Lin-Sivvi rebel EDH, his lack of flying is what did him in, that and the 4 Frost Titans I managed to doppleganger into play keeping everything tapped.",

Then again, you'll notice there are only a few cases where you can actually place charge counters on lands instead of artifacts.\nThis could still be useful in a three-color profilerate deck though.\n\nAnd the art is gorgeous.\n(That is one beast of a bridge if this little piece of land can produce as much mana as the mountains left and right from it :D)",

It's not tournament-legal, since it needs multiple instances of two restricted vintage cards, but it also does not use the Power 9.\r\n\r\nFirst turn, opening hand: Mountain, 4 [autocard]Lotus Petal[/autocard]s, [autocard]Seething Song[/autocard], [autocard]Wheel of Fortune[/autocard].\r\nPlay Mountain, all four Petals, tap Mountain, sac two Petals, cast Seething Song, cast Wheel of Fortune. Discard nothing but draw 7!\r\n\r\nDraw: [autocard]Healing Salve[/autocard], 3 Seething Songs, [autocard]Simian Spirit Guide[/autocard], [autocard]Mass Hysteria[/autocard], Wheel of Fortune.\r\n\r\nYou still have [R][R] in the pool. Sac a Petal for [W], play Healing Salve, gain 3 Life. Sac last Petal for [R], use all mana to cast Seething Song, then cast the two other Seething Songs. You have [R][R][R][R][R][R][R][R][R] in the pool. Toss the Spirit Guide, use [R] to cast Mass Hysteria, use [R][R][R] to cast Wheel of Fortune, hand was empty again, draw another 7. You still have [R][R][R][R][R][R] in the pool.\r\n\r\nDraw: Heartless Hidetsugu, either [autocard]Overblaze[/autocard] or [autocard]Furnace of Rath[/autocard], and three further Spirit Guides, these can even be [autocard]Elvish Spirit Guide[/autocard]s, and two more cards of no import.\r\n\r\nToss all three Spirit Guides, giving you six [R] and an additional three mana ([R] or [G], does not matter). Play Hidetsugu, and either play Furnace, or target him with Overblaze. He has Haste thanks to Mass Hysteria.\r\n\r\nTap him, he deals double damage, hitting your opponent for 20... and you only for 22 of your 23.\r\n\r\nOpponent dead, you have a [autocard]Near-Death Experience[/autocard] but win and enter the annals of Magic history. :P",

So you're saying all creatures that don't have an enters the battlefield effect or haste are useless?\n\nAs for the mana cost, it's 1 one of each color plus 2 to get an 8/12 trampler. And every turn after that, you can pay 2 to call up 12 points of toughness.\n\nAs for manlands, manlands are subject to this thing called \"1 land per turn\". And since most of them are targetable as much as this is, and CAN'T be replayed because they don't go to the graveyard, I'd say they're worse.[/b]\n\n\"[i]And just because it's rather large and has trample when it does decide to be a creature, it is still a legend. Pretty unworthy of legendary status if you ask me. It's like one of the legends from Legends, except instead of having an unspeakably absurd casting cost it screws card advantage and doesn't do anything unless you pay additional mana. Every turn.[/i]\"\n\n[b]I'm not sure whether this is supposed to be a mechanical argument or flavor ranting. Sure, it's legendary. I think Wizards is smart enough to not let players have a turn where they activate 4 different 8/12's with trample for 8 mana, or 2 for 4 mana. [autocard]Mirror Gallery[/autocard] DOES allow it though...[/b]",

And the -1/-1 ability was alone enough reason to ban it.\nThe entire Kamigawa block was a sad mistake, nothing balanced, crappy cards or really overpowered ones, like this and Divining Top.\nBroken card is broken.",

   "text_parsed": "To... well, all previous commentors: Overblaze is one of the most dangerous cards in the game, with an almost endless list of possible cards to combo it with. The best part is that you can even just throw it on a regular creature to double its damage and pump it up just enough to finish a big opposing creature or one of your opponents. Chandra Nalaar is a particularly potent combo, as Donovan_Fabian noted, because by default, she does 10 damage to an opponent and everything he or she controls--enough to hurt that opponent and kill off most creatures in the game. However, having played games where creatures can easily get big enough to survive, doubling that damage is a very strong move, assuming your opponent survives, anyways (another common occurrence for me). And when comboed with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless Hidetsugu\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Heartless Hidetsugu\">Heartless Hidetsugu</a>, anyone with odd life is down to 1, and anyone with even life is dead. Another advantage is that you can cast in on cards your opponents control--at one point, I was in a bad position, and my brother attacked his girlfriend with a 9/9. She was at 35 life, so she let it through. What neither of them expected was for me to smack Overblaze and Double Cleave on his 9/9, quadrupling the damage to 36 and killing her off, allowing me to take the game.<br /><br />As I said, Overblaze is a remarkably potent card that works well in dozens of different combos. Since it only costs 4 mana, I'd say that's a pretty good deal. 5/5",

Your buddy can try to respond by using another shuriken, but the creature will already be tapped, and the cost can't be paid.  If it wasn't a cost, but said :shuriken deals 2 damage, blah blah blah, then tap creature: it wouldn't be a cost, and wouldn't happen until the ability resolved...and he could respond with the others.  As it is, He can only use one at a time.",
