A blanchwood armor when your opponent has no removal is devastating, making them having to either attack to not lose their guys and take a lot of damage to the face, or lose all their creatures every turn to an attacking lure creature.  Even more awesome, you can play your other creatures freely knowing they wont be blocked, massing up a lot of creatures while your opponent tries to deal with this one.  Gorgon flail and colossal might don't hurt either.  Of course you can also channel it into something massive, like a big mycoloth, plated slagwurm, or a meglonoth.  You could also shield of the oversoul this guy so he doesn't die when he takes damage making it so your opponent has to block it over and over.  Gaze of the gorgon saves shinen and kills all your opponents creatures all at once but only works one time.  Might of the oaks is a pretty simple set up too, giving it 7/7, putting it at 8/9.  Pair with prized unicorn for must block lure madness.",

Oh come on. SURELY you're a better player than that. This card is NOT (7) to double a creature's power. First you cast it, then on ANOTHER TURN you use it, hopefully when you can activate it more than once.\n\n\"If you activate it twice it gets more interesting since you can quadruple the power.But then again it's not too much to ask for something you spent eleven mana on, even if it's 'paid in installments'\".\n\nI feel like you are getting way too obsessed with the total amount of mana that is paid. The fact that you can pay it in installments makes a HUGE difference. By YOUR logic, [autocard]Exalted Angel[/autocard] is an absolutely terrible card.\n\nAlso, if you don't like the fact that it does not give the creature trample, then use it with trampling creatures. Who cares about toughness? Obviously the point of this card is to do a lot of damage, so who cares if it doesn't boost toughness? I mean, I sure don't care that my [autocard]Pelakka Wurm[/autocard] is a 28/7 rather than a 28/28 because of this card, because my opponent is pretty much dead.",

In a {R}{W} aggro deck, every point of life counts for the opponent, and playing this down can work in that strategy when facing other aggro decks, for example. I'm actually considering running that scenario for my brother, as his metagame is usually clogged with creature decks. Seems like a good combo to use, and because it only costs {W}, losing it to a destroy spell will result in less mana lost in spending. Plus, in order to get rid of it, the opponent will likely need lands for mana (in my brother's situation this is true), and thus Manabarbs comes in hand yet again.<br /><br />It's fairly narrow, but it has places where it can be strictly better than many other &quot;enchanted creature can't attack or block&quot;.

You could use [autocard]Spellbound Dragon[/autocard] for example.\n(For that particular use, you might also want to compare [i]Exile to Darkness[/i] to [autocard]Veilborn Ghoul[/autocard].)",

   "text_parsed": "If you would like to understand why this card is rated so lowly despite being good in competitive Magic, consider the fact that gatherer ratings are made by casual players, not competitive players. There are for more casual players viewing gatherer pages than skilled competitive players who know anything at all about playing Magic. What casual player wants to sacrifice all of his lands AND take damage? Casual players vehemently hate paying for effects, and sacrificing all of your lands is especially harsh, so it's difficult for them to appreciate a card like this. Someone from R&amp;D talked about this in an article. I don't remember the exact example they used, but it went something like this. If you have a Grizzly Bears (1G, 2/2, no abilities) and another card (1G, 2/2, sacrifice it: gain 1 life) side by side, casual players in general would pick the Grizzly Bears, even though the second card is strictly better. Casual players avoid life loss effects in a similar manner, even on very powerful cards.<br /><br />For anyone interested in getting better at Magic rather than making terrible suggestions as to how to make this card completely broken (DarthParallax's suggestion that you should be able to use it on turn one was especially humorous), I will explain why this card is good. <br /><br />Simply put, it's because it's a land. If this were a creature that cost 2BB and involved you sacrificing your lands, it would deserve the rating it has. However, it's not. Lands that also function as spells are extremely powerful. In many games, this will just be a Swamp with a minor drawback. The drawback is minor because life is used as a resource in competitive Magic - it doesn't matter if you win the game with 1 life left or 20. In other games, however, it will win the late game for you, when each player has exhausted their resources, you will be able to make a 5/5 flier to end the game. When each player has no important creatures on the board and no or few cards in hand, this will be able to win the game, whereas the other player just has a basic Swamp in play that isn't doing much game winning for him.<br /><br />Lands with spell-like effects are inherently powerful. They give you one more spell to kill your opponent with, while still being a land that simply prevents you from being manascrewed. The cost to use this is small, but the upside is high.",
   "text_posted": "If you would like to understand why this card is rated so lowly despite being good in competitive Magic, consider the fact that gatherer ratings are made by casual players, not competitive players. There are for more casual players viewing gatherer pages than skilled competitive players who know anything at all about playing Magic. What casual player wants to sacrifice all of his lands AND take damage? Casual players vehemently hate paying for effects, and sacrificing all of your lands is especially harsh, so it's difficult for them to appreciate a card like this. Someone from R&D talked about this in an article. I don't remember the exact example they used, but it went something like this. If you have a Grizzly Bears (1G, 2/2, no abilities) and another card (1G, 2/2, sacrifice it: gain 1 life) side by side, casual players in general would pick the Grizzly Bears, even though the second card is strictly better. Casual players avoid life loss effects in a similar manner, even on very powerful cards.\n\nFor anyone interested in getting better at Magic rather than making terrible suggestions as to how to make this card completely broken (DarthParallax's suggestion that you should be able to use it on turn one was especially humorous), I will explain why this card is good. \n\nSimply put, it's because it's a land. If this were a creature that cost 2BB and involved you sacrificing your lands, it would deserve the rating it has. However, it's not. Lands that also function as spells are extremely powerful. In many games, this will just be a Swamp with a minor drawback.

Their increased cost really keeps the self-bounce under control.\"\n\"Yeah, your suggestion of increasing their cost like we did with the [autocard]Eidolon[/autocard] cycle in [i]Betrayers[/i] really helped.\"\n\"And we're almost done adjusting the Kirin cycle now. Blue one aside, I like how the red one started with a [autocard]Threaten[/autocard] mechanic, but then removed the haste part for balancing reasons. Almost made a competitive card there, haha.\"\n\"I know right? Inciting kitchen table misplays instead seems far more hilarious.\"\n\"Can we get back to that lifegain Kirin please? I'm still really concerned about that.\"\n\"Yeah you're right. Let's adapt it to the blue one.\"\n\"And potentially gain life as early as [i]turn six[/i]? Are you crazy?!\"\n\"Oh yeah, right. Better go from [3WW] to [4WW] then.\"\n\"You mean [3GG] to [4GG]. We made the [autocard multiverseid=\"84380\"]white one[/autocard] a 'holy wrath'-flavored [autocard]Engineered Explosives[/autocard] for some reason.\n\"Uhm. You guys, I know we had [autocard multiverseid=\"50247\"]Jugan[/autocard] in this block, but flying isn't really green's thing...\"\n\"Good point! [5GG] it is!\"\n\"Shouldn't we at least adjust the P/T or something?\"\n\"Just seconds ago we talked about the format-warping Spirit decks. Do I [i]really[/i] have to recite the list of broken Soulshift creatures to you? Never mind the boost they'll get from other new Spirits like [autocard]Fiddlehead Kami[/autocard].\"\n\"No, please! I'm sorry for asking. You're right. It's fine.\"",

And just because [autocard]Harmonize[/autocard] was good doesn't mean any other green draw is bad. Learn to combo, green draw is always good, and draw + gain life is great to have in a single card. Use it in a G/W life gain with [autocard]Sanguine Bond[/autocard]. Gives you potential 6 loss of life and negates the fact that it's in your deck. Sure, Survival Cache is better, but you have to cast it twice and it's not all at once AND... the kicker... It's white, not green. High cost in green is laughable, 5 mana is nothing.

I've seen less farfetched 5 card combo's than trying to flip this thing. Besides, you can make a far more powerful combo deck than anything this could pull off. In fact, there are cards that do this one's job just as well. And considering this was back when mana burn was still alive (and before Zendikar), this was usually suicide if you didn't have a random X spell in your hand. And really the only kind that would help would be a burn spell, because not many kamigawa cards with X in them need a rediculous amount of mana. Overall, not worth the effort.\n\nThe creature is subpar too, 2/3 for 3? No thanks, I'll go with something decent.\n\n 1/5",

My win-con is Eidolon of Countless Battles from Born of the Gods, slapped with an Ethereal Armor and Daybreak Coronet.\nSome of the cheeky enchantments are auras that steal permanents. There are also a bunch of non-enchantment pieces to help fish out pieces I need; tutors and creatures like Academy Rector.\n I'm excited to get all the pieces together and test it out.",

The fact that you will be able to drop this guy and flip him on turn three almost every game is absurd. Even if your opponent is able to destroy him, you can pay 5 and bring him right back. By the time your opponent is able to fetch up more removal, you will have had plenty of time to get the mana to cast him again at his increased cost. All it takes is a hand full of creatures and/or some kind of catch all (like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pariah\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Pariah\">Pariah</a>), and creatures can't touch you.

I'll bet you new players don't even think Library of Alexandria was a good card either.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't have \"Trample, Doublestrike, Vigilance, Haste, and Lifelink\", then you children just don't even want to look at it. We could have renamed it \"Phyrexian Colostomy Bag\" and had some \"hilarious\" yuk-yuk Mark Rosewater text, or had a picture of an ugly, screaming ogre brutally dismembering goblins, and fiery explosions with oversaturated colors in the background, and then you kids would drool all over it and rate it 4.5/5 stars.",

Either card advantage or even mana ramp! \nGets crazy with [autocard]Momir Vig, Simic Visionary[/autocard].\n[autocard]Thalakos Seer[/autocard] can be your surrogate in a monoblue deck, or [autocard]Kami of the Creskent Moon[/autocard] as a one-sided Howling Mine when used with the vial on your opponent's turn (and is advantageous in team play).\n\n[autocard]Trinket Mage[/autocard] (and [autocard]Treasure Mage[/autocard]) allow repeated tutoring.\n\n[autocard]Erayo, Soratami Ascendant[/autocard] and [autocard]Vengevine[/autocard] might be interesting as well, but would require some more building around it.\n\n[autocard]Whirlpool Rider[/autocard] can be used as [autocard]Mind Moil[/autocard]-like effect.\n\nYet another card i'd like to mention since it's interesting: [autocard]Phantasmal Sphere[/autocard] can be used to give your opponent 0/0s (or even 1/1s for [1]) each turn. Very interesting to trigger abilities. With [autocard]Suture Priest[/autocard], [autocard]Sunstrike Legionnaire[/autocard], [autocard]Twilight Drover[/autocard], [autocard]Glissa, the Traitor[/autocard], [autocard]Toshiro Umezawa[/autocard] or [autocard]Burning Sands[/autocard] for example.\n\n[autocard]Ertai's Familiar[/autocard] can mill you for three. Even if you don't bounce him he'll still mill you, which might be useful with [autocard]Eternal Witness[/autocard] if you support her otherwise.\n\n[autocard]Riku of Two Reflections[/autocard] is a nice addition for the later game.\n\n[autocard]Ninja of Deep Hours[/autocard] ([autocard]Mistblade Shinobi[/autocard] as [autocard]Man-o'-War[/autocard] surrogate) is a nice bounce target as well, given that you have another evasive creature that allows using Ninjutsu.\n\n[autocard]Plaxmanta[/autocard] can be reused as response to creature removal (given that you paid [G])\n\n[autocard]Halcyon Glaze[/autocard] makes a cheap 4/4 flyer, given that you re-cast something each turn.\nGood against aggro are [autocard]Oona's Gatewarden[/autocard] (also synergizes with the Hussar and other faeries) and [autocard]Flood Gate[/autocard] as increasingly strong [autocard]Tremor[/autocard] against non-blue creatures.\n[autocard]Jolting Merfolk[/autocard] can repeatedly tap four creatures.\n\n[autocard]Merieke Ri Berit[/autocard] (easier brought in play with the vial) can be used to take control and immediately destroy a creature each turn.\n\n[autocard]Phantasmal Image[/autocard] is a flexible choice with low (re)casting cost that can even copy an opponent's creature - but consider you might not be able to bounce it then anymore.\n\n[autocard]Equilibrium[/autocard] suits in this deck [i]and[/i] synergizes with gramps for repeated [1U] Unsummons.",

It was like my mind was blown, now I know what they call him the Chimney Pimp. Definitely the best card ever right? Wrong, here comes One With Nothing. First off it combos with Mox Jet allowing you to play it Turn 1. That's right you can play this thing turn one with that insane combo. What's that didn't draw it, well luckily for you there is Demonic Tutor. Everyone knows with a card like this it is best to get it out as early as possible. Now I know a lot of you are saying, well yeah you can play it turn one with the Mox Jet super combo, but what is the point of discarding your hand? Let me ask you something how many times has your opponent played a card like Grixian Probe on you? Or Distress, or Duress, or Blood Oath? Let me tell you it happens. Your opponent gets to see all the cards you have to use against him. With This card they get to see nothing. Its like they wasted a card. Jokes on you opponent I have no hand. You just wait til next turn I am gonna draw something and possible if I have the mana play it, and you aren't going to have any idea what it is. Just think about that if you play against someone who uses this, you have no idea what's coming. You only option is to scoop. ",
