Just Discard him!\n\nConsidering that it took someone two seconds to think of [autocard]Thousand-Year Elixir[/autocard], I'm going to say Wizards was right to be thinking \"you know, this guy recurses himself pretty easily. we might want to do something about that\".\n\nStoneforge is more powerful, to the point of being frikkin banned everywhere, because she didn't have anything like \"skip a turn\" on her. Maybe she should have. Would it have actually been enough, seeing what we've seen her do? I dunno. Probably. Just possibly not.

I call it the &quot;But why?&quot; game. Whenever you explain something, they ask &quot;But why?&quot;. If you answer, they do it again... &quot;But why?&quot;. You can play this game with adults too. The funny thing is that this game either ends in STFU, in a loop, where A causes B, because B causes A or third: &quot;I don't know&quot;. This proves that many things are so common that people usually accept them as they are and never doubt that this might not be true. Basically, it's the logical-chain backwards... and this shows how good your conclusions have been.<br /><br />I've quoted RickCorgan and his comment about <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic Blast\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Psionic Blast\">Psionic Blast</a>. He mentioned the <b>Color Pie</b> and how it forbids this card. The <b>Color Pie</b> is a concept about color-psychology. Cultures differ and some colors are based on how they were used in the past.

   "text_posted": "@ Aaron:\n\nAhh. As I can see are your player analytics well proven, when the younger players here write that they like the block and the \"old guy\" says: [i]\"[autocard]Psionic Blast[/autocard] is reason enough for me to want to skip an entire block's two years in Standard altogether.\"[/i]\n\nIf you've ever had children or spend some time with them, you might have noticed a game. I call it the \"But why?\" game. Whenever you explain something, they ask \"But why?\". If you answer, they do it again... \"But why?\". You can play this game with adults too. The funny thing is that this game either ends in STFU, in a loop, where A causes B, because B causes A or third: \"I don't know\". This proves that many things are so common that people usually accept them as they are and never doubt that this might not be true. Basically, it's the logical-chain backwards... and this shows how good your conclusions have been.\n\nI've quoted RickCorgan and his comment about [autocard]Psionic Blast[/autocard]. He mentioned the [b]Color Pie[/b] and how it forbids this card. The [b]Color Pie[/b] is a concept about color-psychology. Cultures differ and some colors are based on how they were used in the past. In addition, the Magic Color Pie doesn't isn't identical to the physical color cycle or the colors of light, but uses aspects where appropriate and skips things where not. For example are blue and green usually connected to each other. \n\n@ [autocard]Psionic Blast[/autocard] or Timeshifted cards in general\nThese cards were chosen for some reason, maybe even to SHOW the changes the color pie has produced.

With the emergence of this card finally being printed , like all the big name Planeswalkers, it makes for the fun task of building a theme deck, trying to make all the flavor text and named cards work:) In addition, Lim-Dul actually is a very playable card when you stop and realize what all his flavor text cards do, and the SHEER number of zombie cards out there!

Lim-Dul also spans into blue and red, both with named cards and flavor text. With the emergence of this card finally being printed , like all the big name Planeswalkers, it makes for the fun task of building a theme deck, trying to make all the flavor text and named cards work:) In addition, Lim-Dul actually is a very playable card when you stop and realize what all his flavor text cards do, and the SHEER number of zombie cards out there! You really don't NEED to worry about making a creature a zombie when you have greats like [autocard]Haakon, Stromgald Scourge[/autocard] paired with [autocard]Buried Alive[/autocard] and [autocard]Stromgald Crusader[/autocard]. Plus coming out of Coldsnap, fits the original theme of the Frozen Necro Lim-Dul is. I could bore you with other idea's, but the fact remains, Lim-Dul gives birth to a very effective theme deck, along with his other Ice-Age counter-part, [autocard]Zur the Enchanter[/autocard]. That alone should give any Magic Player worth his weight in mana the ideas needed for theme decks, that are effective!",

Strong counterspells create an interesting tension in gameplay as you need to balance counteroffense with the need to actually accomplish anything.

Triskelavus only needs the Blade of the Bloodchief and the KCI. Just saccing one of your Triskelavites to the KCI for 2 mana triggers the Blade's ability, and Triskelavus maintains it's counters.",

Of course,  also may be put into decks of people that have sliver friends and black decks with lifelink and life gain (like me).\n\nEtregan: Of course, can be played in [W] [B] sliver deck with [autocard]Essence Sliver[/autocard], but it seems as much of risk for just 5/5. I know it may have more nice abilities but more Slivers to make him effectie you have, more life you lose.",

Same process at twice the cost, but you get the whole pile. I assume much of the strategy for optimal use of Truth or Tale will extend to Steam Augury.<br /><br /><b>When playing against Truth or Tale</b>, you should know that the more options your opponent has, the worse it is for you, <i>all else being equal</i>. In any random 2:3 or 1:4 split, letting your opponent pick from the bigger pile is a mistake. However, your opponent probably knows that you won't let him/her have the pick of a bigger litter, and so will make the smaller litter more desirable. So, generally, your opponent will split the card he/she wants most and the card he/she wants second-most into separate piles.<br /><br />There are two options for the split - 2:3 and 1:4. The 2:3 split is actually the harder one to deal with, since it gives you the least information about how your opponent values each card. (A 1:4 split typically indicates that the pile of one contains a relatively good card: probably the best or second-best of the five.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>When playing Truth or Tale yourself</b>, you'll probably find that it is pretty risky. Since it's hard to trick your opponent into letting you select from the pile you put the best card into, you basically always get the second-best card. So, on the one hand, you'll almost never get the card you need most. On the other hand, however, the second-best out of five is generally better than a random top-deck. Here's why:<br />Before seeing what they are, you generally have to assume that the top five cards make up a representative sample of your deck, in that they have the same average usefulness as your deck in general. If we also assume an even distribution of usefulness (which might be unfair, mainly because the usefulness of drawing lands is wildly variable depending on the game state), then the median and the mean will be equal, meaning that, in general, the third-best card of the top-five will be about as useful as any randomly-selected card in your deck. Since you usually get the <i>second</i>-best card of the top five from Truth or Tale, it's a bit better than a random topdeck.<br /><br />However, a random topdeck is just &quot;Draw a card,&quot; and you don't even want to pay <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" /> for just that.

According to my calculations (I am not making this up), it's a little weaker than <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum Visions\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Serum Visions\">Serum Visions</a> at twice the cost but at instant speed. Whether that speed is generally worth the high cost and low effect depends on your deck and your opponent's deck.<br /><br />And, of course, nothing quite beats the look on your opponent's face when, late in the game, they tap out for <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated Slagwurm\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Plated Slagwurm\">Plated Slagwurm</a> and you respond with Truth or Tale, leaving three islands untapped, and revealing a single copy of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dissolve\">Dissolve</a> and a single copy of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost Titan\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Frost Titan\">Frost Titan</a> among the five. You split those two; they know you'll counter their spell if they let you have <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dissolve\">Dissolve</a>, and they know the Slagwurm outraces the Titan, so they reluctantly give you the pile with the <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost Titan\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Frost Titan\">Frost Titan</a> in it...<i>and then you cast <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana Leak\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mana Leak\">Mana Leak</a> out of your hand and counter the Slagwurm anyways</i>.<br /><br /><br />Of course, there are situations when this is a little more useful than usual. If you desperately need either any land (i.e. if you're mana-screwed) or any nonland card (i.e. if you're mana-flooded), there's a fair chance this will get you what you need faster/more reliably than, say, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Divination\">Divination</a>, which is the baseline, run-of-the-mill draw spell. After all, if 40% of your deck is land, you'll most likely hit two lands and three nonlands, which you can split to get either type.<br /><br />If you get too few of the kind of card you need to put them in both piles, you can try to bluff your opponent: separate the cards in a 1:4 ratio, putting the single best card of the type you DON'T want in one pile and the rest (including the card you actually want) in the other pile. If your opponent doesn't know what you need, they'll probably assume the card you want the most is in the pile with only one card in it, and they'll let you pick from the pile of four, which has the card you ACTUALLY want!<br /><br />If even that fails, at least you just got rid of four relatively useless cards, improving your odds on subsequent draws.",

And since Teferi is <i>in a different game altogether</i>, your opponent will have a hard time removing him.

I'd just love to see someone try.  Especially since the ruling reads:<br /><br />&quot;400.10c Cards outside the game can't be affected by spells or abilities, except for characteristic-defining abilities printed on them (see rule 604.3) and spells and abilities that allow those cards to be brought into the game.&quot;<br /><br />which, if I understand correctly, means exactly that: the cards outside the game can't be affected by spells or abilities (no removal on the other-game Teferi) <i>but</i> he can still grant his characteristic-defining ability (flash).  So look!  Even Wizards said it will work!<br /><br /><br />On a more serious note, wow.  This is a monster.  Yeah, 4 is no longer the magic number with the introduction of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame Slash\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Flame Slash\">Flame Slash</a> and the M12 reprinting of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin Grenade\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Goblin Grenade\">Goblin Grenade</a>, but still.  Wow.  I'm very glad that Wizards did him the justice of not making him a 1/1 like so many other Wizard Legends (understandably) are.  The guy's a former planeswalker and one of the biggest badasses in the Multiverse.  He's no 1/1.<br /><br />In terms of usefulness, I can't say much that hasn't already been said about how excellent this guy is, but I do see one other combo that works quite well; appropriately, that cards is <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi's Veil\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Teferi's Veil\">Teferi's Veil</a>.

And it keeps every one of your creatures – or at least those you attack with – safe from burn, safe from removal, and safe from bounce.  Since you're in blue already, why not throw down an <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evacuation\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Evacuation\">Evacuation</a> during your opponent's end step and watch them scream?<br /><br />Also, even though the early spoiler art from Teferi's new From the Vault: Legends reprint is pretty nice (if most any card had art that nice I'd welcome it), I just can't get behind it.  This has to be one of the nicest looking cards in recent memory, and I really think they'd have been better off leaving it with the original art.

Neither are great, but at least the Sliver lends its ability to your entire team. Are you worried about it having less value in the mirror?

Hell, just by virtue of being a Sliver, this guy will be bigger and more badass than the Adept any day.\r<br />\r<br />As for the card in question, milling is not really a sound Sliver strategy. Yes, you can get lots of Slivers into play (see esp Brood Sliver), but with Muscle Slivers, Sinew Slivers, poisonous slivers, Crypt Sivers, double-striking slivers, Gemhide slivers, only-blocked-by-slivers slivers, and Might Slivers, your creatures are almost always better suited to a more aggressive strategy. To make milling a threat here, you'll need about ten slivers, say. That's about 1/6th of the deck (a little more considering opening hand and subsequent draws)- which translates to about 3 damage a turn. If you have ten slivers out and can't do at least 3 damage a turn, there is something going horribly wrong. A plan C, at best.\r<br />\r<br />Of course, that's why Spike hates this card. Johnny and Timmy are rather fond of it, and rightfully so. When your friend busts out his Ensnaring Bridge deck because he's just so sick and tired of your sliver rush, you can just smile and begin to ominously shuffle.\r<br />\r<br />Edit (x2 for clarification): Scumbling1, I was under the impression that a card's rating was for the purposes of, in fact, rating that card.

There's an absurd amount of people who hate Baneslayer Angel, but it's still rated well). When players with limited knowledge of the game use the Gatherer, the rating system helps them determine what the community generally thinks of the card's utility without having to read all the comments. So no, it's not an absolute reflection of a card's worth, but of the percieved worth. You imply that a card's rating, because of a large number of confounding variables, is in effect worthless. I really don't think this is so. It can never be a universal, objective truth (as a rating system is always subjective in nature) about a card, but I believe there is value in it. I was pointing out that there was some degree of discrepancy between actual worth and what is being presented as such, so that this cards rating can have just a little bit more accuracy with regards to its utility.",

The third thought would be that the redirected damage would be just that, normal damage to the bodyguard and would not be in the form of a counter at all. unless of course you gave the bodyguard himself infect with and aura or equipment somehow.

Summoning Sickness isn't too much of a problem for me since I'll be flashing it in play at the end of my opponent's turn with either [autocard]Chord of Calling[/autocard] or [autocard]Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir[/autocard]. Unfortunately, I can't really do that with Memory Jar since my deck isn't artifact oriented. (no Tinker, Tezzeret or other artifact tutor)\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying, overall, is that you can make this card sing in the right deck. 4.5/5\n\nPS. [autocard]Consecrated Sphinx[/autocard], lol",
