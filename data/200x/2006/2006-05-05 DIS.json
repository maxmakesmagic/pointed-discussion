It can be used right away, whereas if you want to use [autocard]Pernicious Deed[/autocard] as soon as you cast it, it will cost you one more mana. Also, it's much more finely tuned - Pernicious Deed destroys everything BELOW a certain casting cost, but with this you can simply choose the casting cost that your opponent has the most permanents of to maximize card advantage. And that's not even mentioning the split-ness of it. Very versatile card, and it's in [autocard]Doran, the Siege Tower[/autocard]'s colors.",

   "text_parsed": "\r<br />This is a very impressive (and extremely useful) card in the legacy tournament format.  A few previous players mention this is like the card <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extract\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Extract\">Extract</a>.  Well that is correct in what the card does, although much more thought can easily be poured into the use of this card, then that of Extract.  Any experienced, or competitive MtG player will easily explain the difference between an instant and a sorcery.  Sorcery is designed to be a powerful spell that has a greater effect on the current battlefield.  If a sorcery goes off, it will usually remove multiple targets, if not defeat your opponent(s) out right at that moment.  But thats why they are designed to be played on the owner of the sorcery player's turn, allowing all other opponents to respond if they can.  Now an instant will never really have the same tremendous impact on a battlefield, for they are designed to remove a single target (although there are exceptions).  But in tournament format, many times it <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=boil\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"boil\">boil</a>s down to a single play that makes up the difference.\r<br />\r<br />Going back to this card.  This is far more versatile then your Extract.  Just the fact it is an instant, that alone should already (and very easily) out weigh Extract.  But now at second glance, most players would probably think... Ok sideboard.  Because targeting something that may not even see play may not be the greatest strategy, especially if the opponent is not even running combo.  On the other hand, If the opponent is running combo, well this card will officially allow them to understand that you truly are their father.  Emrakul, Progenitus, Jin-Gitaxis (and other animators) and even a storm deck that runs only 1 tendrils.  Those decks will all bleed when hit by this...\r<br />\r<br />But we shouldn't stray from the fact, that targeting something that isn't on the current battlefield, or targeting the opponent's current hand, should be a main deck choice.  In most cases, it would be a weak main deck choice.  But now... a third glance.  Gone is attached to this.  Now we have a disenchant effect (ok so it doesn't destroy the card, but putting it on the bottom of the players deck isn't good enough?  Not to mention, this even deals with indestructibles) I will tell you with utmost ease that 9 out of 10 legacy deck sideboards will have pithing needle at least!  So disenchant effect can easily take up a few slots of any main deck.

   "text_posted": "\r\nThis is a very impressive (and extremely useful) card in the legacy tournament format.  A few previous players mention this is like the card [autocard]Extract[/autocard].  Well that is correct in what the card does, although much more thought can easily be poured into the use of this card, then that of Extract.  Any experienced, or competitive MtG player will easily explain the difference between an instant and a sorcery.  Sorcery is designed to be a powerful spell that has a greater effect on the current battlefield.  If a sorcery goes off, it will usually remove multiple targets, if not defeat your opponent(s) out right at that moment.  But thats why they are designed to be played on the owner of the sorcery player's turn, allowing all other opponents to respond if they can.  Now an instant will never really have the same tremendous impact on a battlefield, for they are designed to remove a single target (although there are exceptions).  But in tournament format, many times it [autocard]boil[/autocard]s down to a single play that makes up the difference.\r\n\r\nGoing back to this card.  This is far more versatile then your Extract.  Just the fact it is an instant, that alone should already (and very easily) out weigh Extract.  But now at second glance, most players would probably think... Ok sideboard.  Because targeting something that may not even see play may not be the greatest strategy, especially if the opponent is not even running combo.  On the other hand, If the opponent is running combo, well this card will officially allow them to understand that you truly are their father.  Emrakul, Progenitus, Jin-Gitaxis (and other animators) and even a storm deck that runs only 1 tendrils.  Those decks will all bleed when hit by this...\r\n\r\nBut we shouldn't stray from the fact, that targeting something that isn't on the current battlefield, or targeting the opponent's current hand, should be a main deck choice.  In most cases, it would be a weak main deck choice.  But now... a third glance.  Gone is attached to this.  Now we have a disenchant effect (ok so it doesn't destroy the card, but putting it on the bottom of the players deck isn't good enough?  Not to mention, this even deals with indestructibles) I will tell you with utmost ease that 9 out of 10 legacy deck sideboards will have pithing needle at least!  So disenchant effect can easily take up a few slots of any main deck.  If we take it from that angle, now we get a disenchant, that can also potentially extract a card at instant speed and make up some life points, if their isn't a disenchant target.  Either way this card is used, you will find it will never be in vain.",

Read the wording on this card carefully.  It says, &quot;If a spell or ability would cause <u>its controller</u> to gain life, that player loses that much life instead.&quot;  If you are targeting another player with your Healing Salve, the spell is not causing its controller to gain life.

   "text_parsed": "My new musings on Experiment Kraj are that he Looks Like Ivan Ooze and Gatherer needs like a bazillion more Ivan Ooze related comments about him. ^_^<br /><br />THE BELOW INFORMATION IS SO FAR INACCURATE<br />it's horribly complicated, not practical for a normal game, but it works. Blame the Simic guild, because Experiment Kraj really can do this. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin, Lord of Innistrad\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sorin, Lord of Innistrad\">Sorin, Lord of Innistrad</a> is vital, because without his ability to REANIMATE Planeswalkers, you WOULD be limited by a '1 per turn' activation issue. There is a very, very, very good reason that Sorin's wording says 'other' planeswalkers. Wizards knows that if Sorin ever got targeted by his own Ultimate, all hell breaks loose. It's to try to stop Mad Johnnies from pulling this kind of bullcrap. The first iteration involved a subcombo with Tezzeret the Seeker because I thought I needed it. The whole point of the Tezzeret bit was to get a +1/+1 counter on Sorin, allowing Kraj to copy Sorin's ability. There are better ways to get a +1/+1 counter on Sorin, though. I'm not listing them, find them yourself.<br /><br />I'm going to go through this 1 step at a time.<br /><br />1. Mycosynth Lattice makes your stuff into artifacts. This makes your Planeswalkers artifacts.<br />2. March of the Machines makes your artifacts into creatures. This makes your Planeswalkers creatures.<br />3. Experiment Kraj can use any creature's ability if they have a +1/+1 counter on them. You need a repeatable way to get a +1/+1 counter on Sorin so that Kraj can copy his ability. Any combo that nets you +1/+1 counters will do, and my previous suggestion about Tezzeret untapping Kraj to use Kraj's counter-granting ability, while I think it would work, is probably not efficient.<br />4. RECAP:<br />Your Board State: Assume you have found a repeatable way to give Sorin a +1/+1 counter every time he comes back after Kraj targets Sorin himself with Sorin's Ultimate. This would mean that Sorin is an eligible target for Kraj's ability once again. Sorin is ready. Is Kraj?<br /><br />The Million Dollar Question is: Can Kraj use as many Loyalty abilities as he wants without paying Loyalty costs, or not? I was counting that any Loyalty ability the Planeswalker in question could use, Kraj could use for free. I could be wrong about that, but Fate Transfer is another option to give Kraj Loyalty. But this causes the Planeswalker you Fate Transfer to die, with no chance of reanimation! <br /><br />You could still use one PW as a sacrifical lamb so that it enables the rest of the absurd combo to go off without a hitch though. After you have gotten any Loyalty counters on Kraj in any way, any Proliferate combo will work to overload him. Proliferate + Doubling Season combos, which have already been found for 'normal' going infinite with Walkers, will give you all the Loyalty counters you need to do the rest of what I'm saying. There might be other ways to get Loyalty on Kraj. I don't know about them, though.<br /><br />5. So, we do in fact, have a way to repeatably use Kraj to use Sorin's ability to steal the opponents' Planeswalkers, reanimate them, and use their abilities. If you have 2 Doubling Seasons out beforehand, every Planeswalker would enter the battlefield with more than enough Loyalty to immediately go Ultimate with Loyalty to spare. Instead of activating them all at once, you do it in batteries of 3: <br /><br />a. Kraj uses Sorin's Ultimate. Kraj uses Sorin's Ultimate. REPEAT AFTER ME, IF YOU CAN GET KRAJ TO USE SORIN'S ULTIMATE TARGETING SORIN HIMSELF, THIS COMBO WORKS.<br />Kraj targets Sorin and 2 others, to make sure you keep destroying and bringing back Planeswalkers- this destroy/reanimate combo is what allows you to go infinite- each Planeswalker that returns from the Graveyard allows you to use it's power again. <br />b. and c. the other Walkers you target using Sorin's ability. You can only get a Walker to go infinite like this if they are a Walker that is about to be Reanimated by Sorin's ability. <br /><br />Now we have two possibilities:<br />6a. Kraj doesn't need to pay loyalty, this all works just as I said the first time.<br />6b. Kraj DOES need to pay loyalty, in which case you need to find a way to loop Contagion Clasp or some other Proliferator/or Doubling Season effect, in such a way to keep replenishing Kraj's Loyalty. I believe that the popularity of Infect will find searching for Proliferate Combos to be an easy task.<br /><br />7. Kraj can keep using Sorin's Ultimate all Day and all Night to keep refreshing your Planeswalkers, three at a time.

   "text_posted": "My new musings on Experiment Kraj are that he Looks Like Ivan Ooze and Gatherer needs like a bazillion more Ivan Ooze related comments about him. ^_^\n\nTHE BELOW INFORMATION IS SO FAR INACCURATE\nit's horribly complicated, not practical for a normal game, but it works. Blame the Simic guild, because Experiment Kraj really can do this. [autocard]Sorin, Lord of Innistrad[/autocard] is vital, because without his ability to REANIMATE Planeswalkers, you WOULD be limited by a '1 per turn' activation issue. There is a very, very, very good reason that Sorin's wording says 'other' planeswalkers. Wizards knows that if Sorin ever got targeted by his own Ultimate, all hell breaks loose. It's to try to stop Mad Johnnies from pulling this kind of bullcrap. The first iteration involved a subcombo with Tezzeret the Seeker because I thought I needed it. The whole point of the Tezzeret bit was to get a +1/+1 counter on Sorin, allowing Kraj to copy Sorin's ability. There are better ways to get a +1/+1 counter on Sorin, though. I'm not listing them, find them yourself.\n\nI'm going to go through this 1 step at a time.\n\n1. Mycosynth Lattice makes your stuff into artifacts. This makes your Planeswalkers artifacts.\n2. March of the Machines makes your artifacts into creatures. This makes your Planeswalkers creatures.\n3. Experiment Kraj can use any creature's ability if they have a +1/+1 counter on them. You need a repeatable way to get a +1/+1 counter on Sorin so that Kraj can copy his ability. Any combo that nets you +1/+1 counters will do, and my previous suggestion about Tezzeret untapping Kraj to use Kraj's counter-granting ability, while I think it would work, is probably not efficient.\n4. RECAP:\nYour Board State: Assume you have found a repeatable way to give Sorin a +1/+1 counter every time he comes back after Kraj targets Sorin himself with Sorin's Ultimate. This would mean that Sorin is an eligible target for Kraj's ability once again. Sorin is ready. Is Kraj?\n\nThe Million Dollar Question is: Can Kraj use as many Loyalty abilities as he wants without paying Loyalty costs, or not? I was counting that any Loyalty ability the Planeswalker in question could use, Kraj could use for free. I could be wrong about that, but Fate Transfer is another option to give Kraj Loyalty. But this causes the Planeswalker you Fate Transfer to die, with no chance of reanimation! \n\nYou could still use one PW as a sacrifical lamb so that it enables the rest of the absurd combo to go off without a hitch though. After you have gotten any Loyalty counters on Kraj in any way, any Proliferate combo will work to overload him. Proliferate + Doubling Season combos, which have already been found for 'normal' going infinite with Walkers, will give you all the Loyalty counters you need to do the rest of what I'm saying. There might be other ways to get Loyalty on Kraj. I don't know about them, though.\n\n5. So, we do in fact, have a way to repeatably use Kraj to use Sorin's ability to steal the opponents' Planeswalkers, reanimate them, and use their abilities. If you have 2 Doubling Seasons out beforehand, every Planeswalker would enter the battlefield with more than enough Loyalty to immediately go Ultimate with Loyalty to spare. Instead of activating them all at once, you do it in batteries of 3: \n\na. Kraj uses Sorin's Ultimate. Kraj uses Sorin's Ultimate. REPEAT AFTER ME, IF YOU CAN GET KRAJ TO USE SORIN'S ULTIMATE TARGETING SORIN HIMSELF, THIS COMBO WORKS.\nKraj targets Sorin and 2 others, to make sure you keep destroying and bringing back Planeswalkers- this destroy/reanimate combo is what allows you to go infinite- each Planeswalker that returns from the Graveyard allows you to use it's power again. \nb. and c. the other Walkers you target using Sorin's ability. You can only get a Walker to go infinite like this if they are a Walker that is about to be Reanimated by Sorin's ability. \n\nNow we have two possibilities:\n6a. Kraj doesn't need to pay loyalty, this all works just as I said the first time.\n6b. Kraj DOES need to pay loyalty, in which case you need to find a way to loop Contagion Clasp or some other Proliferator/or Doubling Season effect, in such a way to keep replenishing Kraj's Loyalty. I believe that the popularity of Infect will find searching for Proliferate Combos to be an easy task.\n\n7. Kraj can keep using Sorin's Ultimate all Day and all Night to keep refreshing your Planeswalkers, three at a time. Sorin will always be one of the three, you change out the other two in turns until you've gotten to use everyone you want to use.\n\nSorin, Lord of Innistrad is indeed an infinite combo with himself (and some other stuff), and this infinite combo in turn has a ripple effect that allows you to go infinite with all other Planeswalkers, even going Infinite on Ultimates if you add Doubling Seasons to the mix.\nPlaneswalker Abilities are activated. Kraj's errata doesn't clarify whether you can do 6a or if you have to 6b. \nDOESNT WORK.\nI want my notes IN CASE",

Even on turn 2, if you didn't begin and opponent has 2 lands in play, theres high likelihood of 1-for-2 trade.\r\n\r\nLater, when opponent is topdecking, you can Rasie dead some of your dead buddies and bounce one of theirs.\r\nFor example, you could return [autocard]Ravenous Rats[/autocard] and discard their creature...which is kind of complicated way of destroying a creature, but it's a way (plus its something [autocard]Mind Rot[/autocard] or [autocard]Blightning[/autocard] cant do).\r\n\r\nIn either case, it's quite color heavy. Thats why i rate just 4.",

It pretty much forces your opponent to play like a <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" /> player, and <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" />'s enemy colors DO NOT enjoy that. <br /><br />Even the ally colors wouldn't be all that happy. <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" /> having to swing with it's mana bugs and having little access to it's combat tricks. <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /> not being able to mess with it's instant speed kill spells and having to swing it's littler, utility creatures (<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal Assassin\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Royal Assassin\">Royal Assassin</a>, for example). <br /><br />Yeah, nothing is guaranteed. They could tap utility creatures to keep them from attacking. And they could just leave their mana untapped to play things on your turn. But remember: <u><b>If they tap out on your turn and play something, just changing phases will force them to empty what is left in their pool, leaving them crippled</b></u>. My point is, they weren't planning to play that way. It is disruption, plain and simple. And what does disruption cause? Mistakes. Quite an interesting and unique <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" /> card, really. 5/5 <br /><br />Oh, and for those needing ideas of what to do with this: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball Lightning\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ball Lightning\">Ball Lightning</a> deck, easy. They can never attack if they want to absorb damage and they can never play spells if they want to tag your hasty creatures.

For one, no it doesn't <i>force</i> them to pull mana out of their lands. But if they want to play more than one spell, they HAVE to tap it all at once (in response to this triggering). So for draw spells, it creates a hard choice, tap out and take damage to have the option of playing a spell they just drew, or not. But on the other hand, the limited access to mana this creates means less spells/abilities they are tapping lands for, meaning the Barbs does potentially less damage than it would have anyway.",

The random element of singe-mind is sometimes relevant, but this card actually makes them discard, which means that your opponent has to make a (mostly difficult) choice, and in terms of cards, this is card-neutral immediately once it hits the field. As to the bodies, I'd rather have a 2/2 haste than a 3/2 for the most part. The haste makes it more likely to connect since it is a surprise.

The body is a little disappointing. Overall, I've had it shine, and I've had it be awful. It depends on when you draw it. When it hits the battlefield turn 4, generally it's good. Sometimes you can catch your opponent with an almost empty hand on a later turn and the discard gets them for 6 or even 7.

Argh!<br />Without (1), this would have been the biggest difference, since you could simply have mass-murdered all your exposable creatures then in one go and immediately wreck your opponent. Which might be why they added <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=tap&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Tap\" align=\"absbottom\" />. But that makes the +1/+0 boost even less useful, since you'll always want to built up the counters so you can eventually pop it rather than using it for a measly +3/+0.

   "text_posted": "This card is taunting you with potential crippled by mediocrity so hard.\nIt almost hurts as much to think about it than getting stabbed by it.\n\nI'd like this card if just it was for either [i][u]one[/u][/i] of these seven things:\n(1)Tapping the equipped creature to activate the cost,\n(2) The equipped creature got +2/+0 for each counter instead,\n(3) The equipped creature got +1/+1 for each counter instead,\n(4) Using blood counters rather than more comboable charge counters,\n(5) The casting cost of [2],\n(6) The equip cost of [2], and most of all\n(7) The [BR] activation cost to sacrifice it.\nSo many possibilites that would have made this more worthwhile. Argh!\nWithout (1), this would have been the biggest difference, since you could simply have mass-murdered all your exposable creatures then in one go and immediately wreck your opponent. Which might be why they added [T]. But that makes the +1/+0 boost even less useful, since you'll always want to built up the counters so you can eventually pop it rather than using it for a measly +3/+0.
