It is then blocked by a 1/1. It is at this point that, using BDragon123's interpretation of the rules, that the 5/1 deals damage to the creature, which is doubled twice (5x2x2 = 20). So 20 damage is dealt to the 1/1, crushing it into oblivion. However, since the creature has trample, 19 damage gets through to the player. This is very important since BDragon123 considers this to be <b> another instance </b> of dealing damage which would then be doubled twice, again. <br /><br />So we have 19x2 = 38, 38x2=76.

   "text_posted": "BDradon123 makes perfect sense when you look from what I assume is his point of view.\n\nHe takes Trample to mean two separate instances of assigning damage which, considering Anthem of Rakdos' wording, would each be doubled twice.\n\nSo, what we have is the following:\n\nA 1/1 gets +4/+0 from the two anthems, becoming a 5/1 with trample, due to the Warplow, and attacks. It is then blocked by a 1/1. It is at this point that, using BDragon123's interpretation of the rules, that the 5/1 deals damage to the creature, which is doubled twice (5x2x2 = 20). So 20 damage is dealt to the 1/1, crushing it into oblivion. However, since the creature has trample, 19 damage gets through to the player. This is very important since BDragon123 considers this to be [b] another instance [/b] of dealing damage which would then be doubled twice, again. \n\nSo we have 19x2 = 38, 38x2=76. So 76 damage if BDragon123's interpretation of how trample combined with Anthem's damage doubling ability would work is correct. \n\nDoes anyone know for sure?

Say you play it on a thoctar, which also takes white as part of its mana cost making the color easy, and enchant it with sinstriker's will.  Anytime it blocks, it can tap to do 5 directly to the creature even before its taken damage, and then do another 5.  Even better it doesn't have to be the creature its actually blocking, so it can block one creature then tap to kill another seperate attacking creature.  It makes all those non wall innocuous defender creatures actually really good, dealing damage to multiple attackers while defending at the same time.  It's also of course ridiculously good with anything that has vigilance, lifelink, or death touch.  Vigilance allowing a creature to attack and still use the ability at the same time (think twilight shepherd), lifelink regaining you uber life every combat phase, and death touch instant killing any creature without shroud.  Prime example of a good creature for this might be nacatl hunt pride, forcing creatures to block as you please and killing them off.<br /><br />You can view this card as though you are giving first strike to a creature, but the first strike damage can be redirected.",

So yeah, if you enchant it with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lifelink\">Lifelink</a>, you'd gain twice the damage dealt as life. However be careful - Mourning Thrull's life-stealing ability is a triggered ability, which means that it goes on the stack, as opposed to the static lifelink ability. This means two things: First off, your opponent can counter it with effects such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Stifle\">Stifle</a>, and secondly, as opposed to with the lifelink ability, you won't get the life the instant the Thrull deals damage. If your Thrull is 100/1, you're at 1 life (with only the Thrull on the battlefield), and your opponents attacks you with 2 1/1 creatures, you'd die because your life goes to 0 before you gain the life from the Thrull's attack - as opposed to with lifelink, where you'd gain the 100 life from the Thrull's attack at the same time that you're dealt damage, which means that you wouldn't lose the game, and your life total would be 99 once the dust settled.<br /><br />As for my own experiences with Mourning Thrull, I think it's absolutely brilliant.

I used it a bit and found it was more like 2-for-2 a lot of the time, 3-for-2 if you put it on your own guy and they spend removal on it or 4-for-2 if you can utilize your guy to kill others.<br /><br />Therefore, I imagine the best use of this card is on brutal *must remove* style creatures. Imagine <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian Obliterator\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Phyrexian Obliterator\">Phyrexian Obliterator</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko Shade\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Nantuko Shade\">Nantuko Shade</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxathid\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Nyxathid\">Nyxathid</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire Nighthawk\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vampire Nighthawk\">Vampire Nighthawk</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire Nocturnus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vampire Nocturnus\">Vampire Nocturnus</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal Nocturnus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Abyssal Nocturnus\">Abyssal Nocturnus</a>, or similar. Now you have guaranteed card-equality if the creature dies, and if it doesn't well... your win condition just won i guess!<br /><br />This would also work well in a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline of Anticipation\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Leyline of Anticipation\">Leyline of Anticipation</a> deck; as you could respond to removal with this causing near-guaranteed card-advantage.

Lava spike is a sorcery so you use the red copy ability; the fact that it has an instant spliced onto it means nothing to the guildmage.  This copy of the Lava spike will copy all of the abilities the lava spike had at the time it was copied, including the spliced on abilities from the desperate ritual.  This copy goes on the stack on top of the original.  Let the copy resolve, dealing 3 damage and netting you <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" />.  Don't let the original resolve yet, use the mana you just got to trigger the guildmage copy ability again, again targeting the original spell.  This will put another copy of lava spike with desperate ritual spliced onto it on top of the stack.  Repeat the last three sentences as many times as necessary to burn out all of your opponents in the face.<br /><br />Note that if you have training grounds out, each resolved copy of the lava spike with spliced desperate ritual will still have <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" /> left over even after activating the guildmage's copy effect again.  This mana number will never go infinite (unless an opponent has infinite/arbitrarily large life), it will only ever go as large as three plus twice the number of times the copy effect is required to kill all targetable opponents.  Any excess copies will simply fizzle due to a lack of legal targets for the lava spike and the spell will neither do damage or grant mana.<br /><br />Note: The below does not work, I'm just leaving it in for reference sake to theis999's comment:<br /><br />If you want to go infinite mana in red and/or blue through splicing, you'll need to splice the ritual into <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=eerie procession\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"eerie procession\">eerie procession</a> (note the procession just tells you to &quot;search&quot; for a card, you don't have to find one if you don't want to) or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=unearthly blizzard\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"unearthly blizzard\">unearthly blizzard</a>.
