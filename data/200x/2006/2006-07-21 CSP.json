On lunch I ran to wal-mart because they have these value packs that is a booster with 30 loose random cards. I always buy these because they have older packs that are harder to find, and I'm trying to get back into Magic because I stopped playing for 10 years (unfortunately, I missed soo MUCH!). Anyways, I went in and they had one Coldsnap pack, so I bought it, because I have never gotten one yet. And I SWEAR haha that I was thinking, man wouldn't it be awesome if I could get a dark depths. Well, 50 minutes later after I get through the line haha, I get in my car and rip it open. I slowly went through the loose cards, and read every one, slowly and one at a time (it's just what I do lol, I savor the precious moments). They were all EH, but I broke into the coldsnap. And Yep, you guessed it! A FREAKIN DARK DEPTHS right there in my hands!! I am not joking whatsoever, I was seriously so stoked I could barely contain myself! this was the most excited I've been EVER opening a booster. I just love this card so much! It's awesome and EPIC! So anyways, I went back to work, and the rest of my day was beautiful, and here I am now back on here and just had to let you guys know! Magic is awesome, and there truly is nothing like opening a booster and waiting on that last uncommon and slowly sliding it up to see what you've got under it! And to R&amp;D, if you guys read this, I totally understand why you guys make crummy rares (I read the article by Mark Rosewater, and it opened my eyes to why, everyone should read it)! You guys sure know how to bring me down low, only to lift me back up when I pull something like this! It def. creates a balance. If there was no bad, then we wouldn't appreciate the great as much if at all. Anyways, this is huge, MAGIC ROCKS! ",

I prefer stuff like [autocard]Wood Elemental[/autocard] and [autocard]Chimney Imp[/autocard]!  I mean, with [autocard]Chimney Imp[/autocard], you essentially ruin your opponent's next draw AND keep them from using that spell (which could be [autocard]Go For The Throat[/autocard] or another removal that would kill your [autocard]Chimney Imp[/autocard]\n\nAnyways, 99/5\n\nAlso, who knows!  Maybe the next set will focus on Marit Lage!  That would be SWEET!!!!

If you're not running tutors but you are running this, though, you're doing it wrong.  This card is a key component of many different Legacy control decks, and has often been seen in the top decklists for that format.  You have to understand, this card is a strategy on its own: by manipulating the top card of your library, you can often counter any spell your opponent casts.  With <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei's Divining Top\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sensei's Divining Top\">Sensei's Divining Top</a> or a similar card, you can even counter spells this way without using a card of your own, which is crucial.<br /><br />This is not necessarily a card for casual play, where mana costs vary and even with deck manipulation you're not guaranteed to find your answer to what they're playing.  As noted by other comments here, though, in Legacy anything above 4 CMC is unlikely to be hard-cast except via a lower-cost enabler that can be easily countered.  You'll also be running other ways to counter things that, for whatever reason, Counterbalance can't deal with.<br /><br />In casual play, revealing the card to your opponent may also matter, but in Legacy play, once an experienced opponent sees you play this, odds are good they'll be able to immediately name at least 90% of the cards in your deck.

Revealing cards is unlikely to matter much.<br /><br />This is a very technical control card that you absolutely have to build around to use, but its power should not be underestimated.  It gives you the ability to repeatedly counter spells without using cards, or even mana in many cases.  That ability is a key enabler to the control strategy that loves this card.  <br /><br />Finally, having more than one of this card on the board is not useless.  You may not be aiming to get more than one down in every situation, but having more than one can be important.  In situations where you fear your opponent is baiting you, and has a more important spell coming up later in the turn, having two triggers of the ability can actually matter.  By having the ability go off twice, you can let the top card flip first to see if it happens to already be the right CMC, then, if it wasn't, respond before the second instance resolves with your deck manipulation card or ability to change which card's on top.  If you happen to get lucky and hit the right CMC with the first one, you don't have to blow your deck manipulation, and can save it in case they're holding a card with a different CMC for afterward.

Even if you play it on your opponent's turn, so the discard comes very quickly thereafter, you still get to pick and choose what you discard.\n\nThere are quite a few things that can counter the drawback of this card.  [autocard]Library of Leng[/autocard] will let you save all the cards you would normally discard, or pick and choose if there are some you just plain want to be rid of.  As a bonus, it lets you keep your potentially massive hand without having to discard down to 7 cards.  There's also the often overlooked [autocard]Pull From Eternity[/autocard], which you can use to stop the \"return to the battlefield\" part entirely.  And there's always [autocard]Stifle[/autocard]....\n\nGreat card.\n",

Coupled with semi-repeatable recursion like [autocard]Bloodghast[/autocard], persist/undying creatures, [autocard]Eternal Witness[/autocard], [autocard]Deadwood Treefolk[/autocard], and things like [autocard]Gleancrawler[/autocard] or [autocard]Shirei, Shizo's Caretaker[/autocard], [autocard]Cauldron of Souls[/autocard], or [autocard]Mikaeus, the Unhallowed[/autocard] mean there's always stuff going on and things are always coming back from the dead.\n\nTo [i]make[/i] my things dead, I use the usual sac outlets like Ashnod's/[autocard]Phyrexian Altar[/autocard], [autocard]Altar of Dementia[/autocard], [autocard]Attrition[/autocard], [autocard]Mind Slash[/autocard], [autocard]Viscera Seer[/autocard], [autocard]Thoughtpicker Witch[/autocard], [autocard]Spawning Pit[/autocard], whatever you want.\n\n[autocard]Golgari Germination[/autocard], [autocard]Pawn of Ulamog[/autocard], and [autocard]Gutter Grime[/autocard] have basically the same effect as Seks, but they make different types of tokens. [autocard]Genesis Chamber[/autocard] triggers on ETB rather than LTB, but there's enough of both going on to make it basically the same thing.\n\nTo compliment the normal ramp/fixing you need in EDH decks, I stuck in stuff like [autocard]Diligent Farmhand[/autocard], [autocard]Yavimaya Granger[/autocard], [autocard]Sakura-Tribe Elder[/autocard], [autocard]Dawntreader Elk[/autocard], [autocard]Viridian Emissary[/autocard], and [autocard]Yavimaya Elder[/autocard] to ramp while I sac and vice-versa.\n\n[autocard]Fecundity[/autocard], [autocard]Skullclamp[/autocard], [autocard]Soul of the Harvest[/autocard], [autocard]Harvester of Souls[/autocard], and [autocard]Dragon Appeasement[/autocard] are [b]more[/b] than enough to keep my hand full. Also stuff like [autocard]Grave Pact[/autocard], [autocard]Blood Artist[/autocard], and [autocard]Black Market[/autocard] make it so that stuff happens when my stuff dies.\n\nNeedless to say, [autocard]Parallel Lives[/autocard] and [autocard]Doubling Season[/autocard] are pretty snazzy here.\n\nThere are a number of ways to go infinite, but you shouldn't even really need (or want) to. There's plenty going on already, and it's quite deadly on its own.",

This was a welcome top-deck for a player with a month of experience under his belt, and when four mana was tapped on the opposite side of the table from me I had to pay close attention, even with my Auroch army. \n\nThis is a respectable black body (almost uncharacteristically so) that hints at black and red's connection though does not require it.  In a two-color deck, the cumulative upkeep cost is essentially no different than [1].  I really enjoyed how in the Ice Age block, friendly colors were made friendlier.  It speaks back to the core of the game before Ravnica did away with the concept of \"enemy colors\" in many players' minds, in my opinion to the detriment of the game.  \n\nGood draft pick, solid beater, and most importantly, one of the most zombie looking zombies out there.  It looks like it belongs in the Ice Age block, appears massive, and though there's a flavor disconnect about how paying for more and more mana makes him stronger only in the front, it's fun.  This is a fun [b]Magic[/b] card.",

Because otherwise you just lose it all to pay it's upkeep cost. Get X red mana but have to pay that X red mana in upkeep. Using the mana for anything that doesn't end the game in that step is pointless because you would then have to pay that amount of mana used from other normal mana sources for the upkeep cost and defeating the purpose of getting the mana from the card. Unless of course you don't use the mana at all for an extended period of time to use it as a time bomb so to speak and not pay it's upkeep. Of course the longer it is in play the more likely your opponent will be able to get rid of it.",
