There's the problem, I'm guessing, and the real reason they still haven't updated the type: 0/1 isn't used for anything that really makes sense (unless they want to use the serfs' livestock in the form of Goat tokens :P), and Minion doesn't seem all that close a fit flavor-wise.

However, the card <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fog\">Fog</a> doesn't perfectly translate to all 5 colors. Legends was the third Magic setting ever, after <i>Alpha</i> and <i>Arabian Nights</i>, right? I think Darkness is 'bad' in that it too much pigeonholes the potential of this 'cycle' as having to be exact copycats of Fog. <br /><br />And in Time Spiral, they brought it back only as a Timeshifted card, but it doesn't even totally fit to me as a Planar Chaos-like idea. <br /><br />The other colors of Fog should not be exact mechanical copycats, but I do think they need cards that they would use as 'their Fog'. <br /><br />Blue should be a 2-mana enchantment with an activated ability, or a 3-mana enchantment that 'just works', that gives something like Fog to one creature. NOT Shroud, Shroud is stupid, but Fog/Holy Day isn't stupid, it's cool but still reasonable. :) Call it something like Mirror Shield or Magic Water Shield or...you get the idea. We all know what a Blue Fog would kind of look like. Not <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog Bank\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fog Bank\">Fog Bank</a> (a good creature, but just not the same), but the actual spell-that-prevents-damage as opposed to a creature with the Magic built in. <br /><br />Red &quot;Fog&quot; would be awesome. &quot;Fog of Fire&quot;: &quot;Combat damage from creatures is redirected to their controllers this turn.&quot; <br /><br />This would be an awesome blowout card or save-you card. It needs more balancing than just that obviously- this is just a very crude concept, but you start by costing it at 3 or even 4 mana ({2}{R}{R}). I'm not saying &quot;Red Fog&quot; would be easy to make, but I think it can, and should. Something to actually be as cool in constructed as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall of Fire\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wall of Fire\">Wall of Fire</a> is in....nowhere?",
   "text_posted": "I think that some effects ought to be in all 5 colors, and Fog is one of them. However, the card [autocard]Fog[/autocard] doesn't perfectly translate to all 5 colors. Legends was the third Magic setting ever, after [i]Alpha[/i] and [i]Arabian Nights[/i], right? I think Darkness is 'bad' in that it too much pigeonholes the potential of this 'cycle' as having to be exact copycats of Fog. \n\nAnd in Time Spiral, they brought it back only as a Timeshifted card, but it doesn't even totally fit to me as a Planar Chaos-like idea. \n\nThe other colors of Fog should not be exact mechanical copycats, but I do think they need cards that they would use as 'their Fog'. \n\nBlue should be a 2-mana enchantment with an activated ability, or a 3-mana enchantment that 'just works', that gives something like Fog to one creature. NOT Shroud, Shroud is stupid, but Fog/Holy Day isn't stupid, it's cool but still reasonable. :) Call it something like Mirror Shield or Magic Water Shield or...you get the idea. We all know what a Blue Fog would kind of look like. Not [autocard]Fog Bank[/autocard] (a good creature, but just not the same), but the actual spell-that-prevents-damage as opposed to a creature with the Magic built in. \n\nRed \"Fog\" would be awesome. \"Fog of Fire\": \"Combat damage from creatures is redirected to their controllers this turn.\" \n\nThis would be an awesome blowout card or save-you card. It needs more balancing than just that obviously- this is just a very crude concept, but you start by costing it at 3 or even 4 mana ({2}{R}{R}). I'm not saying \"Red Fog\" would be easy to make, but I think it can, and should. Something to actually be as cool in constructed as [autocard]Wall of Fire[/autocard] is in....nowhere?",

   "text_posted": "This land is probably one of the best post Alpha/Beta/Revised edition lands ever made, with the exclusion of the Ravnica pay lands.  Which, this land, if you need to use it multiple times, works best with the guild bounce lands of Ravnica as well.  This is ideal in certain deck types that want to use any given color at any given time, such as evoke elementals, 5 color control, the stupid 3color blocks of planechase and whatever the newer one was.  This is a fantastic answer that is both relatively cheap $$$ wise, and has no draw back other than you get to play another one and another one...",
