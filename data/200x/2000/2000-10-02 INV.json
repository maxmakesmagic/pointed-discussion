And that's when I noticed for the first time that I had a [autocard]Bog Wreckage[/autocard] in play. The only reason it was in my deck was because I didn't have enough swamps. I sacced it for a blue and countered with Spite! That allowed me to stay alive and make a beautiful comeback to eventually win the game.\n\nIt was one of the first out-of-nowhere epic Magic plays that I have ever managed to pull off. I will never forget this card because of that.",

It's tech against enchantments, and it's [i]breakable[/i] tech to boot!  [autocard]Brilliant Halo[/autocard] makes it read \"[1WW]: Destroy target enchantment.\"  That seems pretty good to me, and [autocard]Rancor[/autocard] makes it even cheaper.

Consider this- on your 4th or 5th turn you have played a pretty solid wall or defensive creature to defend yourself effectively and have accumulated 4 or 5 swamps. You lay down Andradite Leech and your opponent laughs hysterically at how idiotic you are because of its obvious drawback. Next turn you power up the leech a bit (NOT TOO MUCH!) and attack. Suddenly the opponent has a major quandary on their hands: toast the leech with a spell or otherwise destroy it with a blocker, or let the 3/3 or 4/4 leech through. This seems like an easy decision until you realize that if they kill it, now you can play spells just as easily as normal, and possibly have cooked something up in the time since playing the leech, OR they let the leech through and take the damage in order to keep you at a disadvantage when playing spells. In the end they will probably let it through at least once or twice before they realize that you've duped them and they'll kill it. GENIUS? YES.",

Oftentimes, you can use this card to take their fatty, block and kill one of their other attackers with it, then sacrifice it (getting around indestructibility, etc.).\n\nFor many games, this card reads \"{3}{U}{U}{B}: destroy target creature and target attacking creature. You gain life equal to the first creature's toughness.\" Which I would play any day. Of course, I mainly play EDH, where unconditional removal is king.

Even if you have to bounce Dromar, at least you won't die next turn, and you'll have a chance to recast him as a blocker before your opponent has a chance to kill you on the turn after that.

The reason to play Elder Dragon Legends, or Primordial Dragon Legends, over other cards, is twofold- first and foremost, even if you plan on making a creature-light deck with little emphasis on the battlefield (relative to other decks), you really want EVERY EDH deck you build to have at least one creature card that can serve as your &quot;Godzilla&quot; to Alpha Strike with and finish the game. Picking a Legendary Dragon for this role happens to be one of the coolest and most fun ways to do it. The second reason you'd pick specifically one of those 10 Dragons is that you have an appreciation for the colorful history of MTG and maybe (not guaranteed, but quite possibly) less of an appreciation for the Mythic Rarity in general, because you think it's not right that every Mythic creature is probably better than most of the Legendary Block Star Rares of yesteryore back when the story was really good.

The <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attendant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Attendant\">Attendant</a>s cycle is the mana fixing you want to pick over Signets if you're running an Invasion Dragon (Crosis lucks out, since his is honestly helpful for his colors, not having any Green to fall back on, and Dromar thankfully fits this de***ion as well!)<br /><br />Also the  Dragon<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name='s Charm\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"'s Charm\">'s Charm</a> cycle, and the Lairs.<br />After you pick those 3 themed cards for your chosen Dragon, you want to look at your Dragon's Theme.<br /><br />Dromar's is Bouncing. As has been pointed out by other posters, it's actually not difficult for Blue and White to make really good use of Bouncing and Enters the Battlefield abilities. I don't know if I'd play Wrath of God in Dromar since I also want it in Treva and I really want to build 5 Decks that feel very different from each other, and thus not boring to play against each other, and thus more fun! :D<br />If you focus on a LOT of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evacuation\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Evacuation\">Evacuation</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devastation Tide\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Devastation Tide\">Devastation Tide</a>-type cards for your sweepers in Dromar, then you probably will be able to find enough that you don't truly miss <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath of God\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wrath of God\">Wrath of God</a>.<br /><br />I really, really don't want to play actually-Esper cards in Dromar, because if I wanted to use lots of Artifacts I'd have picked Sharuum as my Giant Flying Jerk.

I would recommend that Dromar get the Tutors, Darigaaz get the Graveyard (like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living Death\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Living Death\">Living Death</a> and maybe <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari Thug\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Golgari Thug\">Golgari Thug</a>), while Crosis should get the truly HaXXors feeling cards: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought Hemmorhage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Thought Hemmorhage\">Thought Hemmorhage</a> is a good one that feels spiteful and can hit for a lot of damage in EDH, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon of Unrest\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Beacon of Unrest\">Beacon of Unrest</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black Sun's Zenith\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Black Sun's Zenith\">Black Sun's Zenith</a> are cruelly recursible, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syphon Life\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Syphon Life\">Syphon Life</a> is plain brutal against 4 other opponents.<br /><br />I want to try steer the idea of Primordial Dragon decks towards as much diversity as possible, but the truth is it's pretty difficult to tell which Black Dragon should get which Black cards, and it goes on gut instinct more than strict rules- but DO try to make rules for yourself, and follow them, so that you don't wind up with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic Tutor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Demonic Tutor\">Demonic Tutor</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried Alive\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Buried Alive\">Buried Alive</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune-Scarred Demon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rune-Scarred Demon\">Rune-Scarred Demon</a> in all 3 lists.<br /><br />I guess starting out building a Nicol Bolas EDH deck, and then taking out certain CLEARLY Bolas-flavored cards (<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gem of Becoming\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Gem of Becoming\">Gem of Becoming</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel Ultimatum\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Cruel Ultimatum\">Cruel Ultimatum</a>) is what I would do for Crosis.<br /><br />For the &quot;Captain&quot; Legendary creature- the card that I can switch out with the Legendary and keep the 99 exactly the same- I would suggest <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord of Tresserhorn\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lord of Tresserhorn\">Lord of Tresserhorn</a> for Crosis because he's a giant axe-murderer, and Black, Blue, and Red should give you enough control elements that he doesn't hurt you too much without hurting your opponents too.

Fits great in a knight/soldier deck for that reason. I love the flat, dull colors, giving it color but without making it flashy or bright. I love lands that set a feel for the weather and the time of day. The layout is also nice, a downhill view of a vast, flat, grassy field with scattered rocks and the tree in the distance is awesome. Very realistic too! I specifically went out of my way to buy extra of these!<br /><br />5/5 LOVE IT",
