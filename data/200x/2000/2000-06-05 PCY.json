In the older formats (such as legacy, or vintage) there are so many decks that are designed to lock out the opponent in the first 2 turns, if it has not already stole the game by generating a ludicrous storm count.  If you are a regular magic player in these older formats, you will always need to keep an eye open for spells that have replacement effects for general casting.  Now although this card may not be ideal against a storm player, it should generally be very useful against any other annoying lock based deck; Counter-Top, Trinisphere, and I am sure you may know of a few others if you are an avid player.  Most lock designed decks need either an artifact or an enchantment to create the such.  And at worst, you still get a 3 mana disenchant, well at first glance may seem inferior to white's staple disenchant, although this spell being 3 cmc may improve your chances of going around the lovely and ever so annoying  Counterbalance.  Most counter balance decks will have a very limitied amount of 3 cmc cards, and if they do have 3 cmc cards, then its good chances the deck will be tri-color, and be far more susceptible to cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood Moon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Blood Moon\">Blood Moon</a> &amp; <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus of the Moon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Magus of the Moon\">Magus of the Moon</a>.",

Supposedly, almost all tournament players didn't utilize this set but it was a pretty big hit with casual players, due to all the avatars. That's what I read anyway. I personally like the mechanic of the Avatars, it's something you don't see much of at all. But I'm pretty much just a casual player too, so who knows haha. I give it a four for the usability over the other avatars (BESIDES AVATAR OF WOE). It seems to me that this card is the easiest to use it's mana cost reduction in a one on one game. Especially against a saproling or other counter deck. In multiplayer though, my babycakes Avatar of Woe is the Master!!",

Ha, i won't fall for that! Now at first i think i'll just leave a bunch of his smaller creatures unblocked and take the tad of damage...&quot;<br /><br />It doesn't help much that this spell is an instant, it's barely a surprise.<br />And if you really want to use this in your opponent's turn as a mass <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Righteousness\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Righteousness\">Righteousness</a>,<br /> i'd advise to use <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold the Line\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Hold the Line\">Hold the Line</a> instead.<br /><br />I agree it's a flavorful card and i remember being overly amazed about it as a new player. But that's about it.<br />There are lots of better finishers of that kind.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the days were you just played with your crappy decks against friends with other crappy decks and from time to time used to have ridiculously long matches. Where the power of a deck was not decided by your deck-building skills, but by the the expensive cards you managed to trade and could proudly show off with once they were cast...those were the days :D<br />(Not implying that money isn't a question now anymore! But my friends and me shifted from playing decks made with card from our possession to playing all-proxies. And the enitre madness started by seeing awesome cards on the internet and creating single proxies for cards we'd eventually want to buy :D)",
   "text_posted": "@OpenSeasonNoobs:\n\"Oh, my opponent left NINE mana open, and now attacks with all creatures. I wonder what he might be up to.\nCertainly nothing insidious. Probably he just wants me to use my removal spell of one on his attacking creatures, so he can cast a [autocard]Krosan Colossus[/autocard] after combat. Ha, i won't fall for that! Now at first i think i'll just leave a bunch of his smaller creatures unblocked and take the tad of damage...\"\n\nIt doesn't help much that this spell is an instant, it's barely a surprise.\nAnd if you really want to use this in your opponent's turn as a mass [autocard]Righteousness[/autocard],\n i'd advise to use [autocard]Hold the Line[/autocard] instead.\n\nI agree it's a flavorful card and i remember being overly amazed about it as a new player. But that's about it.\nThere are lots of better finishers of that kind.\n\nOh yeah, the days were you just played with your crappy decks against friends with other crappy decks and from time to time used to have ridiculously long matches. Where the power of a deck was not decided by your deck-building skills, but by the the expensive cards you managed to trade and could proudly show off with once they were cast...those were the days :D\n(Not implying that money isn't a question now anymore! But my friends and me shifted from playing decks made with card from our possession to playing all-proxies. And the enitre madness started by seeing awesome cards on the internet and creating single proxies for cards we'd eventually want to buy :D)",
