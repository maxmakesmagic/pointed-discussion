Please, anyone correct me if I'm wrong.<br /><br /><b>Short Answer:</b> If your goal is only to sac the creature, yes you can target it and it will die.<br /><br /><b>Long Answer:</b> Based on 602.2 in the rules, a target is picked before the cost is paid. So AT THE TIME of choosing targets, the creature has yet to be sacrificed, and hence, a legal target. THEN the cost is paid, you pick a creature to sacrifice. If the costs are paid, it hits the stack. This is the first chance anyone has to respond to it. After everyone passes priority, it tries to resolve. The target it illegal (doesn't exist anymore) and it is countered.<br /><br />I hope this is what you were looking for. :-)<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b> I just noticed TheLibertinistic's answer.

   "text_posted": "@Richtmark\n\nI'm going to try and answer your question based on how I read the rules. Please, anyone correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n[b]Short Answer:[/b] If your goal is only to sac the creature, yes you can target it and it will die.\n\n[b]Long Answer:[/b] Based on 602.2 in the rules, a target is picked before the cost is paid. So AT THE TIME of choosing targets, the creature has yet to be sacrificed, and hence, a legal target. THEN the cost is paid, you pick a creature to sacrifice. If the costs are paid, it hits the stack. This is the first chance anyone has to respond to it. After everyone passes priority, it tries to resolve. The target it illegal (doesn't exist anymore) and it is countered.\n\nI hope this is what you were looking for. :-)\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] I just noticed TheLibertinistic's answer.
