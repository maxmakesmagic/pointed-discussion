That sucks :( Any who, how is it possible that I can currently purchase a playset of the revised DT for approximately $35 (including shipping) yet if I wanted to do the same with this BRAND STINKIN NEW version, it's just about DOUBLE the price?! And that for a card that was as easy to come by as walking into your neighborhood super target and buying the preconstructed package with 2 complete ready to play decks for a little more than the individual price of this single card which happens to be less than 2 yrs old right now!! Makes no sense. Insane. What it tells me is, sell your Mox's and Lotus's, your Time reversals and Time Walks, your Thoughtseize's n Clique's and so on and so forth NOW, while the getting is good. Everyone else that wants one, just wait. Sooner or later they will be reprinted (even if they're banned) and when that happens the new ones will be worth double the old ones. An investment, as most people know, is like gambling. Only they flipped it on us! Now they took the gamble part out and as long as you A). Know your history. And B). Know that history will repeat itself, then you're all set! Just be patient, watch for the deck list spoilers and then play middle man by buying them all up, waiting 600 days and double your investment!

That sucks :( Any who, how is it possible that I can currently purchase a playset of the revised DT for approximately $35 (including shipping) yet if I wanted to do the same with this BRAND STINKIN NEW version, it's just about DOUBLE the price?! And that for a card that was as easy to come by as walking into your neighborhood super target and buying the preconstructed package with 2 complete ready to play decks for a little more than the individual price of this single card which happens to be less than 2 yrs old right now!! Makes no sense. Insane. What it tells me is, sell your Mox's and Lotus's, your Time reversals and Time Walks, your Thoughtseize's n Clique's and so on and so forth NOW, while the getting is good. Everyone else that wants one, just wait. Sooner or later they will be reprinted (even if they're banned) and when that happens the new ones will be worth double the old ones. An investment, as most people know, is like gambling. Only they flipped it on us! Now they took the gamble part out and as long as you A). Know your history. And B). Know that history will repeat itself, then you're all set! Just be patient, watch for the deck list spoilers and then play middle man by buying them all up, waiting 600 days and double your investment! Shoot, Magic the Gathering pays better dividends then BANKS. And there's NO risk! I love it : P",

Yes, you can just play 1 if it's &quot;restricted&quot;.<br /><br />I appreciate your desire to get back into Magic, but what you're suggesting is to get into Vintage. In Vintage, you can essentially play 1 copy of any of the cards banned in Legacy. As in, you could play 1 copy of Black Lotus ($3000+/ea), 1 copy of Ancestral Recall ($600+), 1 copy of Time Walk ($500+), etc. etc. etc. People really don't play Vintage. It's far too expensive to spend nearly $10,000 on a deck that only you and a few others can play. It's like the Fortune 500 of the Magic community. <br /><br />If you have a Tutor and want to play it, start in EDH (Commander). It's legal there, you only need 1 copy of each spell (since you can't play more than 1 copy of a spell (excluding basic lands)), and many, MANY more people play EDH. It's perhaps the most popular casual format.<br /><br />But in terms of Tutor, I love how there's new art for (arguably) the best card in Black. As many can tell, cards made pre-2003 (pre-new border) had a different, more 'story book' art style than now. Now, cards are darker, and use more definite shapes and figures.

Yes 2 more mana, but you get that in power and touphness and no drawback. You even have a alternate way of getting him out by sacing 3 creatures.",

This acts as a powerful beater, but its abilities only affect itself, and don't stop your opponent at all. If you haven't lost any life, it takes four hits from Akroma to kill you, and if you had a victory plan set up before this is played, you will probably still win. Gisela, on the other hand, is in my opinion the best angel in magic, because it is the kind of card that lets you win even if you seemed to have no chance otherwise. Don't get me wrong, this is still a good card, and i expect it to be played in some competitive formats, but it shouldn't be rated so high, (higher than Black Lotus in fact!,) regardless of the art, which is amazing and way better than the original.",

So lets say you do three drills a day, in a little under three years you will have done 1001 drills. Which is presumably about as good as this. You are now some crazy combo of a bear and a soldier.

   "text_posted": "@ Kelptic183  Well, if this is better than 1000 drills, frankly I think that is a pretty good thing for drills. +2/+2 is, on average, the size of a bear. So lets say you do three drills a day, in a little under three years you will have done 1001 drills. Which is presumably about as good as this. You are now some crazy combo of a bear and a soldier. So prolly around the size of an elephant. Which is pretty bloody impressive. Also, keep in mind, that your average soldier does more than three drills a day and trains for longer than three years.

It was printed in a Duel Decks, and while precons and DD in particular can have some great cards (destroying the myth that precons suck, look at Premium Graveborn's ENTOMB or this very deck's DEMONIC TUTOR), it is still true that these products are tailored to please Vorthos before Spike. For example, that Demonic Tutor could have been a Vampiric Tutor, or a Mystical Tutor, which arguably possibly better for costing less....but there was no way the Demon Deck would have run the Vampire Tutor. <br /><br />The fact is, there ARE better sacrifice outlets-among artifacts especially-but they picked this card because it fit the Theme. As an aura, this is easier to destroy, because it is only as strong as the combined weaknesses of TWO cards, not one: the enchantment itself, which has no protection, and the creature it is dependent on to survive.  This card was picked for this deck because it's kind of a top-down card and it's 'thing' is &quot;It turns your creature into a Demon!&quot;<br /><br />So that's the cons of it, given fair exposure. While it's easy for all the cards with good art and a possibly useful ability to get a fanclub on Gatherer, I felt that people were brushing aside Baconradar just because he didn't fall for that.<br /><br />On the other hand, there ARE good uses for this card, and one thing that Baconradar got sorely wrong was <i>&quot;A deck that wants exactly both those things is pretty niche and even there the card is only mediocre at both&quot;</i> Compare Grave Pact to Butcher of Malakir, or Anowan, Ruin Sage to Abyss (?) I think (?)  Forgive me if I'm mixing up my enchantments, but there are some new black Vampires that mimic classic old cards and functionally the vampires are just better: You get the effect of the Enchantment, AND you get the flying damage and blocking of the body.  In game 1, which kinds removal your opponent has might be relevant, but every 75-card Deck/Sideboard combination should be able to come up with an answer to each major card type, making that factor less important in game 2. The point I'm trying to make is that the card with 2 uses- being both a creature and an enchantment or other effect, is better than the card that just does one of those jobs.  Maybe a deck isn't going to be looking for exactly those two effects, but if you think of this as a split card, where one side says 'pump creature' and the other side says 'sac engine', then it begins to look more like one of those good vampires I was talking about before.<br /><br />That all being said, I find that Sacrifice-effects are somewhat difficult to exploit for some reason, and in order to keep even or better on tempo and card advantage, you almost always have to run a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave Pact\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Grave Pact\">Grave Pact</a>-like effect that punishes your opponent/s whenever something of yours dies.  I'm not saying that it's a bad way to go if you have all the cards, just pointing out that it does need more support than the average strategy.  My final rating is 2.5-3 stars.
