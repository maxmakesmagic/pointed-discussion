Bah ha ha ha ha ha ha you're wrong.\r<br />Let's look at a different combo for a second, other than all this infinite strip mine crucible stuff,\r<br />Strip Mine + <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ornithopter\">Ornithopter</a> + <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradise Mantle\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Paradise Mantle\">Paradise Mantle</a>\r<br />This combo lets you use Strip Mine's mana gain to get mana ramp. So essentially, it's replacing itself, so then it can take out an enemy land no sweat. That puts the enemy behind by one land.\r<br />Also note, that one land can be very useful. For instance, a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Cloudpost\">Cloudpost</a>. Moving on, let's look of other things that work with Strip Mine,\r<br />First, you've got your graveyard into library effects, for instance Emrakul, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek, Butcher of Truth\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kozilek, Butcher of Truth\">Kozilek, Butcher of Truth</a>, and a really nice one, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest for Ancient Secrets\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Quest for Ancient Secrets\">Quest for Ancient Secrets</a>. These effects may seem... bad... to some people, but that's why there's <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition Map\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Expedition Map\">Expedition Map</a>, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket Mage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Trinket Mage\">Trinket Mage</a>, or any other search artifact 1 cost or less, or any other search for a land(non-basic) card. Like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic Tutor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Diabolic Tutor\">Diabolic Tutor</a>, or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beseech the Queen\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Beseech the Queen\">Beseech the Queen</a>. Feel free to use all of them, since you're just going to reuse your deck over and over and over. If you want more usefulness out of the map, throw up a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salvaging Station\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Salvaging Station\">Salvaging Station</a>.\r<br />Secondly, you've got your effects that make the -1 land on self, and -1 land on enemy chance to -1 land on enemy, +1 enemy land on self, -1 land on self. Although the math says it's zero, tradgng a strip mine for a cloudpost.... good deal. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea's Cradle\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Gaea's Cradle\">Gaea's Cradle</a>, same thing. Here is the card, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prince of Thralls\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Prince of Thralls\">Prince of Thralls</a>. Definintely an expensive card on his own. Just ponder that for a second... I'm sure that there is more cards for this, but that was the only one I found. Moving on!\r<br />Thirdly, you've got your return effects. -1 enemy land, -1 self land, +1 self land. Of course, these are also expensive. Like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun Titan\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sun Titan\">Sun Titan</a>, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charnelhoard Wurm\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Charnelhoard Wurm\">Charnelhoard Wurm</a>. Pretty expensive... but these are like the first, except more direct. Sun Titan can be activated by entering the battlefield, so I'm sure you can figure out a way to make that ridiculous. Of course, also listed here should be Crucible of Worlds... but you already know of that.\r<br />\r<br />So, now that we've seen some combos.... I'm sure a consistent theme has been removing of lands on both sides. Well, that's amazing when comboed, I'm sure we've all seen. What can this card do alone though? You can bar a turn from the enemy, that's what. -1 land and -1 land can be quite dreadful. Turn 14, enemy had 14 lands, they're all excited for Emrakul in a turn. It's your turn. Strip mine! Jk on next turn Emrakul! I'll just play a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Draco\">Draco</a>. Okay, your turn again? Back up to 14 lands? My turn... well, gotta pay my upkeep. Doo doo doo, draw, doo doo doo, oh hey, strip mine! I'll just use that... Oh yeah, and swing for 9. You're back up to 14 lands? Nah back down to 13. Swing for another 9! Oh, you've got more lands? Nahhhh..... back down to 13. Swing again..! You're dead!\r<br />\r<br />Strip Mine can hold an enemy at bay. If it's your turn, and you're up against a blue, and you're about to play something nice and that blue has his two islands untapped... and you're worried... you don't want to take that risk..... slap down a strip mine and say, HA NO COUNTERSPELLFORUUUUU! And then throw down whatever you've got. A simpler example of this is winning with one drops. Turn 1, forest, throw down a green one drop, turn 2, strip mine, throw down another green one drop, kill their land. turn 3, strip mine, throw down another green one drop, etc. Turn 5, you'll have 5 one drops on the field, they have absolutely nothing. You'll have done 10 dmg, just from one drops. 3 mana cost for a card will begin to look real expensive.",

Seeing as blue shouldn't be the color people splash for for beaters, it was banned (I'm pretty sure, but if not the reason is mentioned in the article on the FtV:Exiled).\r\nMode, have you realized that Kird Ape IS included in FtV:Exiled? Or did you just phrase that sentence wrong?",

That's called Looking at Extra Cards and will get you a warning from a judge.  <br /><br />@swords_to_exile<br />&quot;The reason you can pick less than 4 cards is because the word Search always always always means you can fail to find if you wish.

You can only fail to find if the card you search for has to fulfill stated criteria.  For example, you can fail to find on Gifts Ungiven (even if the Oracle hadn't updated it to &quot;up to 4 cards&quot;) because all of the cards must have different names.  Likewise you can fail to find with cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival of the Fittest\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Survival of the Fittest\">Survival of the Fittest</a> because the card is required to be a creature.  However, as long as your library has cards in it, you can't fail to find with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic Tutor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Demonic Tutor\">Demonic Tutor</a>, and the like... because the search has no criteria other than that the card be... well... a card.  <br /><br />@Everyone else that doesn't understand &quot;Failure to Find&quot;<br />Relevant part of the rules:<br /><i>701.14b If a player is searching a hidden zone for cards with a stated quality, such as a card with a certain card type or color, that player isn’t required to find some or all of those cards even if they’re present in that zone.</i><br /><br />Think about it this way - if you have to prove a card fulfills certain criteria, which you can tell easily by whether or not the card forces you to reveal them to your opponent, then it is <i>possible</i> that you cannot fulfill those criteria, and since you cannot reveal hidden zones, your opponent just has to accept your failure to find. <br /><br />As a somewhat unrealistic example for Gifts Ungiven, your deck is made up of 57 <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Island\">Island</a>s, 1 Gifts Ungiven, 1 <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace, the Mind Sculptor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jace, the Mind Sculptor\">Jace, the Mind Sculptor</a>, and 1 <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure Hunt\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Treasure Hunt\">Treasure Hunt</a>.  When you cast Gifts Ungiven, you will <i>always</i> fail to find on at least one card:  you will only ever find at most 1 Island, 1 Jace, and 1 Treasure Hunt.  At the very least you will find 0 cards (if you have no cards left in your library).  <br /><br />Certain cards have to have complex wording to take into account &quot;Failure to Find&quot;, such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal the Clans\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Signal the Clans\">Signal the Clans</a>, which would be fairly imbalanced if it were just &quot;Search your library for 3 creatures, reveal them, and add one at random to your hand&quot; (functionally the effect) because you could simply fail to find on 2 creatures and add one to your hand for <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" />.",
   "text_posted": "@Fictionarious\nFirst of all, read the oracle text. \nSecond of all, see below for how \"Failure to Find\" works.\nThird, revealing a hidden zone (like your library) is not something I would recommend you try at a DCI-sanctioned event.  That's called Looking at Extra Cards and will get you a warning from a judge.  \n\n@swords_to_exile\n\"The reason you can pick less than 4 cards is because the word Search always always always means you can fail to find if you wish. So I can search for 4 but only find 2. It's different than Target 4 x, because there has to be 4 targets, and if one fails, then the spell does.\"\n\nThat's not entirely true.  You can only fail to find if the card you search for has to fulfill stated criteria.  For example, you can fail to find on Gifts Ungiven (even if the Oracle hadn't updated it to \"up to 4 cards\") because all of the cards must have different names.

And two, this card was chosen for this promo set because of its impact on the game when it was legal in Standard. It may only be a third of its parent's glorious self, but the fact remains that Lotus Petal made many, many decks that much scarier to deal with. At the very worst, it gave you two mana on turn one. That's a complete turn ahead of your opponent, and I have fashioned a deck that wins turn two whenever this is in my hand. My good friend has done the same with his deck, only turn one. It's a supporter card, sure, but because of its history within the game, and the way it can still break a deck in half, gives it the right to be in this mini-set, and thus have its mythic status.",

Reading the comments however there are a few people that have yet to grasp the gravity of what this is, to those people I offer you this. At its core Magic the Gathering is a card game and in that context let's look at what Necropotence does in the context of another game poker. Let's say you are playing someone in poker and you get to play 5 card draw and the opponent must play 5 card stud; statistically you will win more hands of poker because you simply have access to more cards to put together a better hand. You will see more pairs, more three of a kinds, and have chances to attempt to capture straights or flushes vs your opponent who gets 5 cards to put together their winning hand and that's it. Now take that concept and apply it to Magic the Gathering; with Necropotence you get more cards to put together a winning hand. Let's say you are a bit conservative with it and only give yourself 2 cards a turn vs your opponent's 1. Mathematically you should have access to double the creatures your opponent will draw, double the answers you have to what your opponent can do, double the lands drawn to what your opponent will. This is the basic concept of card advantage to the few of you who don't get it. Non-believers try it, and you will see that you will begin winning more games then you lose.

   "text_parsed": "\r<br />I think I speak for most players, and I am sure many would debate that perhaps I am utterly and completely wrong.  But this card is far too playable on turn 1.  Infact it is so easy to play turn 1, that if I choose to play anything other the blue (via <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force of Will\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Force of Will\">Force of Will</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Daze\">Daze</a>, my experience of Magic becomes pointless.  A lock of this magnitude should not be coming from a single source alone.  If you really want to debate this card, just test it yourself.  Put together any deck that optimizes a turn 1 Trinisphere drop.  Now run it against any other deck that doesn't use Force of Will or Daze.  If the player with Trini draws an opening hand sphere, their chances of winning that game shoots up by 75%  instantly.  That shit is faster then Split Second!  Now lets factor in getting hosed for mana.  If your playing against trinisphere and you get stuck at 2 mana or less for whatever reason, the 75% jumps to almost 90% for the Trini player.

   "text_posted": "\r\nI think I speak for most players, and I am sure many would debate that perhaps I am utterly and completely wrong.  But this card is far too playable on turn 1.  Infact it is so easy to play turn 1, that if I choose to play anything other the blue (via [autocard]Force of Will[/autocard] or [autocard]Daze[/autocard], my experience of Magic becomes pointless.  A lock of this magnitude should not be coming from a single source alone.  If you really want to debate this card, just test it yourself.  Put together any deck that optimizes a turn 1 Trinisphere drop.  Now run it against any other deck that doesn't use Force of Will or Daze.
