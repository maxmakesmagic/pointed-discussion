Force Spike either forces your opponent to leave one extra mana open or get hard-countered, which means their tempo and curve is basically one whole land-drop behind.

   "text_parsed": "&quot;X Mana: You may put a creature card with converted mana cost X or less from your hand onto the battlefield face down as a 0/1 creature. Put X mask counters on that creature. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery. The creature's controller may turn the creature face up any time he or she could cast an instant by removing all mask counters from it. This effect ends if the creature is turned face up.&quot;<br /><br />That is such a functional change. While the power and toughness were never defined on the original card, and are still up for debate due to global -x/-x effects and stuff like fling, the card clearly requires you to pay it's casting cost, not it's mana cost. Furthermore, the mask counters are pointless and the face down creature can perform ulterior operations while 'morphed'. It can attack and block and deal damage, which further deviates from how this card operates. This summation is a way the card could have been done, but by no means does it do the cards ability justice.",
   "text_posted": "\"X Mana: You may put a creature card with converted mana cost X or less from your hand onto the battlefield face down as a 0/1 creature. Put X mask counters on that creature. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery. The creature's controller may turn the creature face up any time he or she could cast an instant by removing all mask counters from it. This effect ends if the creature is turned face up.\"\n\nThat is such a functional change. While the power and toughness were never defined on the original card, and are still up for debate due to global -x/-x effects and stuff like fling, the card clearly requires you to pay it's casting cost, not it's mana cost. Furthermore, the mask counters are pointless and the face down creature can perform ulterior operations while 'morphed'. It can attack and block and deal damage, which further deviates from how this card operates. This summation is a way the card could have been done, but by no means does it do the cards ability justice.",
