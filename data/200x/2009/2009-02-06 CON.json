Compare this to Knight of the Reliquary, for example, as a means to thin your deck and you'll see that the Armillary Sphere is vastly inferior.  Armillary Sphere is a decent mana-fixer, and might be useful in multi-colored decks that don't use green.

You took the total power of your creatures, and cut it in half. even worse, now your opponent can play ANY DESTRUCTION SPELL THEY WANT, considering it is turn 11 or so, and completely wreck your entire strategy. congratulations on not attacking for the win on turn 6, 7, 8, or 9, you showed some brilliant restraint there. People must fear your mind games! \"well, he could have won the game.... but he took his massive win condition and made it into one, easily dealt with creature.\" Congratulations on the EPIC FAIL. Have a nice day everyone else.",

It's a good card, but only if a hoop is jumped through. A card like Cancel is good due to it's placement in a number of blue decks, it's non-adherence to a certain strategy, and it's lack of hoops to jump through. If you pay 1UU, you're getting a Cancel, not a potentially stronger or weaker Cancel.\r<br />\r<br />Now here's how that logic is flawed. Players are going to jump around the hoops in unexpected ways. They can ignore the hoops and break them in half. And chances are, if one takes the time to build a deck around the hoops (decks that have lots of support already- elf decks for Wolf-Skull Shaman, or Jund decks for the ooze), these cards can get out of control. When the deck is actually made, there is no downside. You're playing around it. And sometimes the benifits are so strong they dominate the game. It's like being rewarded for what you were going to do anyway.\r<br />\r<br />Overpowered? Certainly not.

This is an opinionated topic, so here's mine. If it were draft, Swords would get the edge, in that scenario, 9 times out of 10 you'll be using this only on your opp and i'll gladly give you 1-6 life over a free not to forget ADDITIONAL land. With that said however, I do believe that this card, when properly built around, CAN an often will be more dangerous.. This logic seems to be a trend in MTG these days (bringing back old powerhouses, changing the name and giving them an ability with a clause that only makes them better than their predecessor in the right scenario(s), a prime example of this would be Avacyn Restored's &quot;Miracle&quot; cards). Any whoo, putting this card in the right deck could give you added speed in the event you find yourself mana screwed but also be your source of removal with a tolorable drawback (I say tolorable because the majority of the time, if you're going to give your opp 1 additional land, chances are he/she already has enough to play his/her threats because obviously they already did and 1 additional land (to them) is most likely water under the bridge.. Note: NOTHING in Magic is Full-proof, not even the most feared Power-9. If that were the case, this beloved game would go down in a burning heap of stalemate. Too conclude: I personally like this card better for the versatility. Yes, I would rather give life points instead of land to my opp in exchange for 1 of his/her guys, but I myself would rather recieve a land when using it on myself and in the right deck, such as my U/W control in which I run 4 of's of this and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misthollow Griffin\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Misthollow Griffin\">Misthollow Griffin</a>, it ROCKS. If you play a card like this ONLY for removal, pick yourself up a playset of S2P, but if it's versatility you're looking for, this is the one you want. Thanks for listening! :))",

This logic seems to be a trend in MTG these days (bringing back old powerhouses, changing the name and giving them an ability with a clause that only makes them better than their predecessor in the right scenario(s), a prime example of this would be Avacyn Restored's \"Miracle\" cards). Any whoo, putting this card in the right deck could give you added speed in the event you find yourself mana screwed but also be your source of removal with a tolorable drawback (I say tolorable because the majority of the time, if you're going to give your opp 1 additional land, chances are he/she already has enough to play his/her threats because obviously they already did and 1 additional land (to them) is most likely water under the bridge.. Note: NOTHING in Magic is Full-proof, not even the most feared Power-9. If that were the case, this beloved game would go down in a burning heap of stalemate. Too conclude: I personally like this card better for the versatility. Yes, I would rather give life points instead of land to my opp in exchange for 1 of his/her guys, but I myself would rather recieve a land when using it on myself and in the right deck, such as my U/W control in which I run 4 of's of this and [autocard]Misthollow Griffin[/autocard], it ROCKS. If you play a card like this ONLY for removal, pick yourself up a playset of S2P, but if it's versatility you're looking for, this is the one you want. Thanks for listening! :))",

I play a 5 color planeswalker deck that gets up to over ten mana every game and can survive for that long EVERY game.  (It is very different than AJ Sachers  build)  With Wraths, Condemns, Volcanic Fallouts, Austere Commands, planewalkers (esp. Garruk), etc. it is very easy to get up the mana.  Some people say it is worse than Cruel Ultimatum and that is probably true in the typical 5 color control decks but in my planeswalker deck this is clearly better.  In my deck each players life totals are largely irrelevant because I rarely go below 10 life and have ajani goldmane to usually keep above 20 and I usually do not win by chipping away my opponents life total.  The deck also runs 0 creatures main and 0 creatures side, so the pulling the creature from your gy never happens.  Forcing the opponent to sac one creature is generally insignificant.  So in that deck Cruel Ultimatuum basically just allows me to draw 3 and my opponent to discard 3, which is good enough to run 1 of but not earth shattering and certainly does not win me the game outright.  Nicol Bolas on the other hand wins the game 90% of the time he hits.  I usually just target a land with his plus ability, he gets up to his ultimate the 3rd turn he hits, which forces the opponent to sac most of his lands, discards whatever they have in their hand, and they lose 7 life.  If they ever play another land it just gets destroyed immediately and the ultimate goes off again a couple of turns later.  Or if they have creatures you need to take care of you can take whatever of those you need and recruit them to your side.  Plus, it is essential in the mirror to pick off their other planewalkers.  In brief, it wins the game.  Period.  I can always hit the mana and its better than milling with jace or putting creatures into play from the graveyard with Liliana thats for sure!",

Emrakul may actually be stronger than Bolas, but only at TWICE the mana! Progenitus dies very badly to both. Nothing has 'protection from sacrifice'!",

Good responses to this besides countering the spell (which really only works if you plan on running blue) are spells like Spectral Procession (which already enjoys heavy play) and Dragon Fodder (which is much cheaper to obtain). Both of those spells would provide you with legal targets, and when played in response to a spell, would resolve first, giving you your spirits or goblins BEFORE you're forced to sacrifice something.  <br /><br />3 - <i>Prevention</i><br />Consider the spell Angelsong: <br />Angelsong<br />W1: Prevent all combat damage that would be done this turn, Cycling: 2<br />Angelsong doesn't target anything, it just prevents damage. If it had a target, it would be damage from a source. Therefore, since it targets DAMAGE, Progenitus can't damage a player who plays Angelsong that turn. <br /><br />4 - <i>Protection</i><br />Yes, you can use protection against protection, but not in the way you might think. Progenitus cannot be blocked by anything, even if another creature also had protection from everything. However, if a PLAYER has protection from a source all of the rules for protection apply.<br />Example: If I have protection from black and you declare Progenitus as an attacker, since he is black all of the damage that would be dealt to me by him (or any black source) would be prevented. If I play Runed Halo and name Progenitus as a card I wish to have protection from, Progenitus cannot harm me (as long as Runed Halo is in play).<br /><br />Also, keep in mind two things:<br /><br />1 - <i>Not all spells and effects that can potentially harm Progenitus are bad. </i><br />Every &quot;liege&quot; card from the Shadowmoor block will give Progenitus +2/+2, since their static abilities stipulate &quot;all creatures you control,&quot; not &quot;all target creatures.&quot; A great card that offers universal pumping is Glorious Anthem, which gives all creatures you control +1/+1. Spells that don't specifically target Progenitus (for example, if a spell reads &quot;put a +1/+1 counter on any number of creatures you control,&quot; the spell does not target Progenitus and counters don't target, since they aren't spells, so you can put a counter on him if you wish.<br /><br />2 - <i>Unless a card specifically contradicts this, all cards with protection only have protection (or grant protection) when IN PLAY (or &quot;ON THE BATTLEFIELD,&quot; if you're more familiar with that wording)!</i><br />This is BAD because you can be forced to remove Progenitus from the game by certain spells if it's in your hand. This is GOOD because you can use spells an effects to play Progenitus for cheap from your hand.<br /> <br /><br />I think I went a bit overboard here. The beauty of Progenitus is that he will never hit the graveyard; you just keep shuffling him back into your deck. This is especially cool if you have ways of retrieving him from there. I myself have considered <i>Mayael the Anima</i> as a means of playing Progenitus, as well as <i>Mindwrack Liege</i> and the Hideaway lands, especially <i>Mosswort Bridge</i> and <i>Windbrisk Heights</i>. Also, the equipment <i>Deathrender</i> can bring Progenitus out of your hand for FREE. Consult the Gatherer and READ THE RULINGS on Deathrender for more information. <br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br /><br /> ",

He's flying over lava, the look on his face screams Black Metal. Just awesome.",

Filigree has a nice effect of being able to untap cards for mana... and with the etherium sculptor on the feild it makes for a nice little boost in being able to use it. consider being able to use any of its effects twice in one turn without having two on the feild, that's a number of possibilities: gaining 10 life in a turn (if you have good blockers you can really jack your lifepoints up with this, and if not, then go for 5 and then use the green to make a good blocker later), drawing and discarding two cards (ultimately the LAST thing you're going to want to do, but if you're looking for a single finishing card it will really accelerate your progress), giving a monster your opponent controlls -4/-4 (trust me, this effect is not one to play around with, it can actually kill a red deck by itself... and if there's no real good ones to use it on you can use it to power down some of the stronger monsters and force your opponent not to use them), dealing 6 damage to an opponent(when playing red, this effect is amazing... especially when playing with that forge of rath((spelling is not accurate, but it's from the 10th core so you can look it up)) to boost the damage up to 12 a turn, and if you can pull this off you don't even need strong attackers), and you can use the green to give a monster +8/+8 (then use that card that gives it a +1/+1 counter for each point of attack... use it all on mycloth and you've become pretty much unstoppable, or just wait and use it on your opponents turn to make them think twice about attacking you... i mean you could turn a little 1/1 myr retreiver into a 9/9 powerhouse, but i think that you're not going to get very far",

Third, the ping ability is a bit costly yes, but with a few other things to use with it, like Gorgon Flail, Quietous Spike, or even Basilisk Collar it is just evil.  Something I thought about implementing in a naya domain deck of mine is ping Child of Alara to death, while keeping him above 5, and paying 1 with Spearbreaker Behemoth (if you have it to spare) it sticks around to play and hit an unguarded opponent next turn, even if it is only for 6 less than when it came out.

Let's compare the Squire to each of these cards and see which is ultimately the best choice.<br /><br />1.) Sigiled Paladin - The first advantage Squire has over the Paladin is that it doesn't require as much mana fixing.  It's much easier to play a turn 2 card that costs 1W than a card that costs WW, especially if you're running all three of Bant's colors.  The second advantage Squire has over the Paladin is that it has evasion, which is nice in an exalted deck.   The drawbacks of Squire are that it is smaller to begin with, and it lacks first strike, an ability which can be as good as evasion in the right kind of deck.  Overall, I would go with Aven Squire over Sigiled Paladin in 7 out of 10 situations.<br /><br />2.) Sighted-Caste Sorcerer - Same exact casting cost, so neither card gets the advantage here.  Aven Squire has evasion, the Sorcerer can give itself shroud.  On the surface, this seems like a no-brainer, but with the removal-rich play environment, it's a very difficult choice.  The biggest problem with exalted is that opponents can pick off your attacking creatures one at a time with spot removal if you don't have some way of protecting them.  This makes the Sorcerer a very attractive two-drop.  On the flip side, big creatures are also quite common, and the Sorcerer will have trouble breaking through the likes of Woolly Thoctar.  I say go with Aven Squire.<br /><br />3.) Jhessian Infiltrator - Squire definitely has the advantage of casting cost over the Infiltrator, especially when you take into account Davidhuman's point that the Aven Squire curves nicely with Akrasan Squire.   Also, Jhessian Infiltrator lacks the exalted ability, so doesn't contribute to her own cause.  Granted, the Infiltrator has a superior form of evasion, but I don't think that alone makes up for her drawbacks.  Aven Squire again takes the cake.<br /><br />4.) <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deft Duelist\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Deft Duelist\">Deft Duelist</a> - I didn't mention Duelist above, but I thought she deserved comparison in this discussion.  Her casting cost is slightly worse than Aven Squire and Sighted-Caste Sorcerer, but not as bad (IMO) as Sigiled Paladin or Jhessian Infiltrator.  She entirely lacks evasion and exalted, but instead packs first strike and shroud - which can be impressive when she's beefed up by other exalted creatures.  Until the release of Conflux, Deft Duelist had been my card of choice for this slot in an exalted deck.  Conflux gave us Aven Squire, but also gave us Path to Exile and a number of other spot removal cards.  Duelist, like the Sighted-Caste Sorcerer, has problems with Woolly Thoctar and its ilk, but at least her first striking gives her a chance against them.  That, and who says we can't play Path to Exile on their creatures? Deft Duelist remains my card of choice.  ",

At this point, you have a large creature advantage.<br /><br />In response to the card the enemy draws, consider two points.  One, it might be a land; a good thing for a creature-lock deck.  Two, even if it's a creature, he's gotta summon it.  If nothing else, you have a mana advantage.  Moreover, Gwafa can zap whatever they throw out.  The only way the guy can get a creature advantage is if he summons 2 creatures per turn, and even then you can bribe the better one.  Meanwhile, you spend the rest of your mana summoning your own creatures, who face a hamstrung opposition.<br /><br />Others observed Gwafa's inability to handle swarm and non-creature decks (maybe burn decks? idk ask blurrymadness); this is true.  He's also vulnerable to flicker effects, like unsummon.  A Gwafa deck must have other cards to protect him where he's weak.  But this is true of all cards; so we have to build decks which combo well with Gwafa's abilities.<br /><br />What combos well with Gwafa?  Creature-lock spells are an obvious start.  In my experience, low-drop first strikers like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant Sureblade \" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Bant Sureblade \">Bant Sureblade </a> handily deal with whatever doesn't get bribed.

You may have other preferences.<br /><br />At any rate, I think Gwafa Hazid is an outstanding card who makes a real solid win condition.

But this is true of all cards; so we have to build decks which combo well with Gwafa's abilities.\n\nWhat combos well with Gwafa?  Creature-lock spells are an obvious start.  In my experience, low-drop first strikers like [autocard]Bant Sureblade [/autocard] handily deal with whatever doesn't get bribed.  I like [autocard]Piston Sledge [/autocard] and [autocard]Wings of Hope [/autocard] too, since then you can get a creature +4/+4 and flying for a series of buffs which cost no more than 3 each.  You may have other preferences.\n\nAt any rate, I think Gwafa Hazid is an outstanding card who makes a real solid win condition.  He's one of my favorite cards of all time, and fully deserves the 5/5 I give him.",

The rule of thumb is simple: effects with &quot;counter&quot; or &quot;prevent&quot; won’t have any affect (although you can still play/activate them, nothing will actually <i>happen</i> as per the errata).<br /><br />If you just keep that in mind, you can really easily remember what cards will and won't work against a 5+ Banefire, or any card that has the words &quot;can't be countered&quot; or &quot;can't be prevented&quot; on it.<br /><br /><i>Things that <b>won't</b> affect Banefire</i>:<br /><b><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Counterspell\">Counterspell</a></b>/<b><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Negate\">Negate</a></b> etc.<br /><b><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian Angel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Guardian Angel\">Guardian Angel</a></b> (yeah it's an old one, but the first that comes to mind)<br /><b><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purity\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Purity\">Purity</a></b>'s ability<br />The <b><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pariah\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Pariah\">Pariah</a></b>/<b><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cho-Manno, Revolutionary\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Cho-Manno, Revolutionary\">Cho-Manno, Revolutionary</a></b> combo (it will still &quot;work&quot; and the damage will go to Cho-Manno, but he'll die since he has the word &quot;prevent&quot; in his ability.)

(Yes, including <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Progenitus\">Progenitus</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193452\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"193452\">Emrakul</a>, unless you make Banefire colorless in the latter case.)  This applies even if the target is given these abilities while Banefire is on the stack.  For example, if you play Banefire on your opponent's <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purity\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Purity\">Purity</a>, and your opponent taps <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother of Runes\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mother of Runes\">Mother of Runes</a> to give <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purity\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Purity\">Purity</a> protection from red, Banefire doesn't do anything.  It's not countered, and the damage isn't being prevented, but it no longer has a legal target, so it fizzles.  Fizzling is not preventing damage or countering a spell, so the 5+ ability does nothing.  The same situation arises with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vines of Vastwood\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vines of Vastwood\">Vines of Vastwood</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok Stealthsuit\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Neurok Stealthsuit\">Neurok Stealthsuit</a>, or other sources of Shroud.<br /><br />So as you can see, the damage most certainly <i>can</i> be avoided.  Your most common culprits in damage prevention/countering won't work, but there's a healthy list of cards that can keep uncounterable, unpreventable damage from going through.  Still, it looks like with things like protection from X, shroud, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Unsummon\">Unsummon</a>-type spells, it's much easier to get this spell off against a player than against a permanent.  Make of that what you will.<br /><br />One more important note: although <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindbreak Trap\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mindbreak Trap\">Mindbreak Trap</a> works since it exiles the spell rather than countering it, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Guile\">Guile</a> does NOT allow normal counters to work against a 5+ Banefire.  While <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Guile\">Guile</a>'s ability does result in exiling, it reads &quot;If a spell or ability you control would counter a spell...&quot;.  So since a non-counterable spell (obviously) can't be countered in the first place, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Guile\">Guile</a>'s ability to exile cards won't trigger.<br /><br /><br />That said, this is an excellent spell; just about the best it is at what it does, and for that alone it deserves 5/5 in my opinion.  Pretty much the prime reason I sideboard 4x <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Redirect\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Redirect\">Redirect</a> in most every deck.  Also, while a situation where both cards come up seems unlikely, it's a great middle-finger to someone who flipped <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo, Soratami Ascendant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Erayo, Soratami Ascendant\">Erayo, Soratami Ascendant</a>.",

For example, if you play Banefire on your opponent's [autocard]Purity[/autocard], and your opponent taps [autocard]Mother of Runes[/autocard] to give [autocard]Purity[/autocard] protection from red, Banefire doesn't do anything.  It's not countered, and the damage isn't being prevented, but it no longer has a legal target, so it fizzles.  Fizzling is not preventing damage or countering a spell, so the 5+ ability does nothing.  The same situation arises with [autocard]Vines of Vastwood[/autocard], [autocard]Neurok Stealthsuit[/autocard], or other sources of Shroud.\n\nSo as you can see, the damage most certainly [i]can[/i] be avoided.  Your most common culprits in damage prevention/countering won't work, but there's a healthy list of cards that can keep uncounterable, unpreventable damage from going through.  Still, it looks like with things like protection from X, shroud, and [autocard]Unsummon[/autocard]-type spells, it's much easier to get this spell off against a player than against a permanent.  Make of that what you will.\n\nOne more important note: although [autocard]Mindbreak Trap[/autocard] works since it exiles the spell rather than countering it, [autocard]Guile[/autocard] does NOT allow normal counters to work against a 5+ Banefire.  While [autocard]Guile[/autocard]'s ability does result in exiling, it reads \"If a spell or ability you control would counter a spell...\".  So since a non-counterable spell (obviously) can't be countered in the first place, [autocard]Guile[/autocard]'s ability to exile cards won't trigger.\n\n\nThat said, this is an excellent spell; just about the best it is at what it does, and for that alone it deserves 5/5 in my opinion.  Pretty much the prime reason I sideboard 4x [autocard]Redirect[/autocard] in most every deck.  Also, while a situation where both cards come up seems unlikely, it's a great middle-finger to someone who flipped [autocard]Erayo, Soratami Ascendant[/autocard].",

It mills, which I've always been a fan of, and has the potential to mill a great deal, especially if it hits a mana pocket or if the deck is low on creatures, and of course, when it hits a creature, you become the proud owner. Given that a lot of the better decks tend to be heavy in spells and outstanding creatures, Telemin Performance can really hamper your opponent while netting you a decent creature.",

I don't think you understand how mana and mana pools work. This is a little simplified, but it should be all you need to know:<br /><br />Say you have an <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Island\">Island</a>. When you tap it for mana, it adds <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" /> to your <i>mana pool.</i> This called a &quot;mana ability,&quot; and nobody can respond to it. This means that your opponent(s) can't say &quot;HERP DERP I CAST <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=WRECKING BALL\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"WRECKING BALL\">WRECKING BALL</a> TARGETING THAT LAND BEFORE YOU GET THE MANA.&quot; You tap for <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" />, and <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" /> is added to your mana pool instantly.<br /><br />Then, in order to cast a spell (say, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Preordain\">Preordain</a>), you announce that you're casting it (say, &quot;I cast Preordain&quot;), then pay its cost. You can only pay mana costs with mana in your mana pool. When you pay that cost, the mana you spent on it is emptied from your mana pool (which makes sense--if you only tapped one Island, you don't have a spare <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" /> floating around after you cast Preordain).<br /><br />Any mana left in your mana pool empties out at the end of each step and phase. That means if you have leftover mana (maybe you tapped an <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet Boilerworks\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Izzet Boilerworks\">Izzet Boilerworks</a> for mana and didn't spend the <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" />), it'll vanish between different parts of the turn. I'm not going to go into steps and phases here, but you might want to look it up--this means that if you tap the Izzet Boilerworks during your <i>precombat main phase</i> before you attack and cast a Preordain, then the leftover <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" /> vanishes before combat starts, which means you can't use it to do something fun during combat like cast <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning Bolt\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lightning Bolt\">Lightning Bolt</a>. This also means that any mana in your mana pool goes away at the end of your turn.<br /><br />So how does this relate to Kaleidostone? Well, if you've read through all of this so far, then you should have a new understanding of mana. When you activate Kaleidostone's ability, you're adding mana to your mana pool, just as if you were tapping an Island or that Izzet Boilerworks. This mana can be used to pay costs, such as the mana costs of spells. (You could use it all at once to cast something like a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fusion Elemental\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fusion Elemental\">Fusion Elemental</a>, or you could use it to pay different parts of other costs.) When you spend the mana on a cost, then it vanishes from your mana pool. Any of the <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=R&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Red\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" /> you add that you <i>don't</i> spend by the end of a step or phase vanishes from your mana pool.<br /><br />So just like how tapping an Island doesn't give you &quot;permanent mana&quot; for the rest of the game, using Kaleidostone's ability doesn't either. Like all mana in the game, it's added to your mana pool, so it goes away when you spend it or when the various phases and steps of the turn end.",
   "text_posted": "@Pesti1ence: [i]\"when i tap the mana required and \"break\" the kaleidostone, the mana produced from it... is it permanent mana that i can draw on for the rest of the match?\"[/i]\n\nNo. There's no such thing as \"permanent mana\".

This means that your opponent(s) can't say \"HERP DERP I CAST [autocard]WRECKING BALL[/autocard] TARGETING THAT LAND BEFORE YOU GET THE MANA.\" You tap for [{U}], and [{U}] is added to your mana pool instantly.\n\nThen, in order to cast a spell (say, [autocard]Preordain[/autocard]), you announce that you're casting it (say, \"I cast Preordain\"), then pay its cost. You can only pay mana costs with mana in your mana pool.

That means if you have leftover mana (maybe you tapped an [autocard]Izzet Boilerworks[/autocard] for mana and didn't spend the [{R}]), it'll vanish between different parts of the turn. I'm not going to go into steps and phases here, but you might want to look it up--this means that if you tap the Izzet Boilerworks during your [i]precombat main phase[/i] before you attack and cast a Preordain, then the leftover [R] vanishes before combat starts, which means you can't use it to do something fun during combat like cast [autocard]Lightning Bolt[/autocard].
