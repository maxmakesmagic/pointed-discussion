I think the shroud is more of a white and green function, however, as there have been white and green cards in the past that have done this, such as Ravnica's green and white hybrid, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Privileged Position\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Privileged Position\">Privileged Position</a>, Time Spiral's green <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect of Mongoose\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Aspect of Mongoose\">Aspect of Mongoose</a>, and Shadowmoor's white <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater Auramancy\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Greater Auramancy\">Greater Auramancy</a>. However, in terms of how well this card is, I personally don't care for it. The shroud seems to do more harm than good, as there isn't too much land destruction going around in everyday play, and there also aren't too many things that can actually target lands at all.

   "text_posted": "This is farily costed. Yes, technically its Magic and everything might as well cost 0 'in the right deck', but 6CMC in Enemy Colors is nothing sneeze at, and more difficult to cheat out, than say, Phyrexian Om Nom Nommer. (Obliterator)\n\nTurn 1-3ing this is just dorky. Please don't, that's mean. \nFinding a nice quick way to shave off a mana or two like Everflowing Chalice, and this is a complete bomb on turn 4-5.\nIf you're Joe Lucky and play with only basic lands, but actually hit Plains, Swamp, Plains, Swamp, Plains, Swamp as your first six land drops, then this is still a completely valid card to play.

For one thing, it defintley makes one of your creatures big and brawny in a hurry, but it does cost 6 mana or 3 per two turns, either way thats slightly less cost effective especially if its stopping you from playing something from your hand that would have used the mana spent on it.  For example divinity of pride itself only costs 5, and at the full 6 mana you could be playing a flameblast dragon.  The added 2 toughness on this card vs. the loxodon warhammer is a major bonus though, with the new lightning helix and lightning bolt coming back, you need extra toughness on your creatures if you don't want them to die really easily.   The lifelink is also amazing, your doing a lot of damage and getting life back.  The downside is two fold, the first is that with all that mana cost, if the creature you attach it too is removed, the constant moving it to a new creature (if it isn't destroyed by artifact hate) takes up an extra 3 mana a turn.  The second issue is the card is taking the place of something else, and that something else could simply be another creature with lifelink.  Is it better to have an extra creature on the field with lifelink or an equipment that can give lifelink to your other creatures?  That really depends on the deck.",

Value this card for its token production (though <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetary Reaper\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Cemetary Reaper\">Cemetary Reaper</a> may arguably be better, depending on who you ask), value it for its life loss function, but recognize that it's not in a useful colour pairing for a dedicated zombie deck.",

   "text_parsed": "@Thaviel:<br /><br />Thought I'd answer your question/s with some coherence. ^^<br /><br />First off, sacrificing pridemage is part of the ability's cost, and you can't interrupt costs as they don't use the stack. That's the beauty of instants and abilities that require sacrificing - if they try to destroy it, you can sacrifice it in response and nail an enchantment or artifact. If you try to nail an enchantment or artifact then its already left the field.<br /><br />Secondly, spells and abilities are independent from their source once they're on the stack. Destroying the source won't prevent the spell or ability, unless it specifically says so. Even an ability like Prodigal Pyromancer (tap, *Prodigal Pyromancer* deals 1 damage to target creature or player) will still work - if the permanent is no longer on the battlefield, its last known information was used (it has no bearing on this, but if it was an ability that did damage equal to Pyromancer's power then it'd use its last power value before it died).<br /><br />Thirdly, if an ability or spell is multi part (ie. your example of &quot;1: Qasali Pridemage destroys target enchantment or artifact. Sacrifice Qasali Pridemage&quot;) and one of those parts can't be completed, the rest still go on as normal.

That means that although they are thinning their decks down, they will also have fewer lands in their deck, and thus, more cards to mill with Mind Funeral. \n\nPerhaps the most necessary card to play with this (and... well, all mill decks) is [autocard]Surgical Extraction[/autocard]/[autocard]Extirpate[/autocard]. Extraction is essentially a free \"well, now I see your strategy. I'm going to make it not work\", while Extirpate is a \"I'm going to screw your deck up. Don't try to stop me\". \n\n'sigh' with this as well, it looks like [autocard]Deathrite Shaman[/autocard] can fit in YET ANOTHER modern deck.",

Another thing it does which is subtle is filters the cards you are searching for so that they are 'virtually artifacts'-i.e. X doesn't have to be whatever color the permanent you are searching for is. So you could make great use of this and aggressive 1-cost Black Zombies or Red Goblins....if you somehow had a Bant-based deck that wanted to summon those creatures, or a Black or Red deck that could cast a 'Bant' spell reliably- or you could even use it to get other wierd gold combinations (BW, RU, GRB) and 'filter' them all into Bant. This point would have been made a bit stronger if it showed a Dragon next to the Sphinx in the art.<br /><br />There are really two MAJOR groups of decks this card is excellent for: Lands Matter Decks and Heavy-Gold Decks. Of all the 'CMC=0&quot; cards, I would say that Lands are the cards which <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=U&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Blue\" align=\"absbottom\" /> is a nice fair price for. Lands Matter Decks would be ones that think of Tutoring up specific utility Lands like Silver Bullets- I'm thinking Mystifying Maze or Academy Ruins or Valakut or other lands where the mana they tap for is not the important thing. If all you want is just to get more lands out to tap for different colored mana though, Cultivate, Harrow, and Kodama's Reach are all better just because they're mono-green, and Fetch-Lands are good options for non-Green decks that want to do the same thing.<br /><br />Heavy Gold Decks use this with the color you are 'filtering into' when you fetch something. That requires good mana-producing support for at least 4 colors though, since you have to cast this reliably and it would be better if you could cast what you search for without HAVING to draw this, to prevent your 'targets' from being dead draws without this. And it's a short hop, skip, and jump to go from 'this could make a nice 4-color deck' to 'this could make a nice 5-color deck'. Unlike many gold cards, this card compares best to Dramatic Entrance, Gifts Ungiven, or Unburial Rites as 'rather than play this Guild's/Shard's/Commander's theme, let's just cheat stuff out and 'whitewash' our mana to do whatever the heck you feel like doing. <br /><br />Seaside Citadel is actually the last card I would recommend for the mana base of a Wargate Deck because I'd want to be thinking a bit more outside the box than trying to fit it just with other White/Green/Blue cards. Bant decks do best when they are White-Weenie-ish and keep to low CMC. this is going to be a 4-cost most of the time in a deck like that, and sometimes 5, 6, or 7 cost. Not a good fit for Bant after all.<br /><br />Actually, I just thought of a third thing you can do: It can be a really bad 'Entomb entwined to Animate Dead' card. I don't think trying to use this on cheap creatures just so that X can be low is really the most effiient use. And while fetching lands is efficient, it doesn't always feel like something I want to be spending a whole card to do (especially if I'm running a goldilocks base already). <br /><br />If you want to Demonic Tutor and Cast a creature in one go, go big or go home and pick something that will really smash the board if it works. You'll have to pay full mana price plus a bit, so it's not really going to be very fast, but you can at least cheat around having to draw the creatures in question, and since it's green you can shave maybe a turn off of the normal ETA of the creature you're trying to summon if you use a lot Rampant Growth effects. I still don't think this is the best thing to be doing with the card though. It's much much better for lands than creatures.<br /><br />EDIT: Allies and Slivers are kind of stupid tribes in that this card is a bit bonkers with them. Any other creature type in Magic?

In this deck it worked significantly better, as now I only used it to get more mana (it also makes it pretty easy to find that one elusive [autocard]Sol Ring[/autocard]). Basically, use it for mana and low-cost cards only.",

Flameblast dragon is also pretty similiar by comparison and one mana less with flying, and the x ability can hit players and planeswalkers.  He's still a good creature, but 7 mana is to late in the game to be making a come back, you're either already ahead when you play him, or your not likely to be able to make a board advantage with just thraximundar, as any pacifism, crystallization, or other removal will take care of it completely.  It's true though, if you play him and your opponent has no removal and doesn't draw any for several turns, then it kills.",

Secondly as you name a card on the resolution of the spell you can 'miss a target' in your opponents hand unlike Lobotomy where the card you name must be in your opponents hand.    <br /><br />I rate this card alot lower than Cranial Extraction because of the addition coloured mana it costs to cast, it also requires two different types of mana which makes it hard to splash unlike Cranial Extraction.

It can deal 3 damage for each card you name in their hand. \n\nThought Hemorrhage is similar to Lobotomy because it has the 'extraction' like effect although both Thought Hemorrhage and Cranial Extraction require the caster to name a card rather than choosing one from the target players hand. \n\nIn response to Cenelder, firstly Thought Hemorrhage causes you to look in a players hand, if it didn't your opponent could easily lie.  Secondly as you name a card on the resolution of the spell you can 'miss a target' in your opponents hand unlike Lobotomy where the card you name must be in your opponents hand.    \n\nI rate this card alot lower than Cranial Extraction because of the addition coloured mana it costs to cast, it also requires two different types of mana which makes it hard to splash unlike Cranial Extraction.

Therefore it would have been just a fine red knight at uncommon rarity. <br /><br /><b>@ Naya Shards:</b><br /><br />Although I don't like tri-color decks, no matter if it's a wedge or a shard-like combination, I like the concept of forming distinct guilds, groups or &quot;worlds&quot; within a set.

So I let him play my Jund deck. Half way through the game he shows me this card and asks me what he should do with it. I'm a fair player so I told him how it worked and that he could kill 4 of my creatures or all of my buddies.

We've played every day since then and now I finally have someone to play with! YES!",

   "text_parsed": "My experience of this guy is nearly the opposite of bowlofgumbo's (&quot;He seems good on paper, he really does. In reality this guy isn't that sick. Cool? Sure. Useful? A little. Game changing? Not really, no. 3.5&quot;). Basically, this creature is a sitting 'soak', or counter spell, for destruction magic.<br /><br />When I first looked at the card, I thought it could be nice and occasionally helpful, but would generally turn out to be not all that great. I've now played a number of games with a deck in which I have 4 Escorts, along with a number of other excellent and effective creatures. My experience is that, <b>so long as you have a bunch of other creatures in play of the type an opponent would want to destroy or remove as quickly as possible, alongside the Escort, Escort is by far worth much more than the three measly mana paid for it</b>. It's a buffer for all of your other creatures for one turn; not one card - one turn. If you have more than one in play, the opponent just has to sit there and sigh, knowing that she or he must expend a number of destruction spells (even mass spells like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath of God\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wrath of God\">Wrath of God</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague Wind\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Plague Wind\">Plague Wind</a>) equal to the number of Escorts in play <b>before</b> beginning to have an effect on creatures other than Dauntless Escort. If those destruction spells have mass effects (like Wrath), they must be expended on separate turns, taking more time and allowing more damage from the creatures being escorted. So, so powerful.<br /><br />The only way to get around it is to use mass bounce like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evacuation\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Evacuation\">Evacuation</a> - then maybe counter it as it heads back out, since you're running Blue at that point. Otherwise, you've just gotta use your spells one-for-one on Escort (unless you've got some kind of awesome, repeatable ability on a permanent - maybe <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal Adept\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Temporal Adept\">Temporal Adept</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal Assassin\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Royal Assassin\">Royal Assassin</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast Dragon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Flameblast Dragon\">Flameblast Dragon</a>) before getting to the <b>other</b> creatures in play - the ones you're <i>really</i> after.<br /><br />I see a 5/5 rating as indicating perfection in a card. I'm not sure that any card printed after '94 deserves a 5 rating (examples would be <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox Sapphire\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mox Sapphire\">Mox Sapphire</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black Lotus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Black Lotus\">Black Lotus</a>), though several cards <b>do</b> warrant a 4.5 - such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Counterspell\">Counterspell</a>. <b>I give Dauntless Escort a 4.5 of 5 rating. I feel that it's one of the very best creatures that a creature-driven deck could have in play.</b> Having more than one in play at one time creates a nearly hopeless situation for a one-on-one opponent - at least, it's basically hopeless for a number of destruction spells played (and separate turns to play them) equal to the number of Escorts in play - or for a number of turns equal to the number of Escorts in play, if Wrath-like spells are the destruction at hand.<br /><br />Is there a card that 'exiles', say, target creature and all other creatures that share a color or name with target creature? That would really be the best way to deal with multiple Dauntless Escort cards in play - even better than the mass bounce like Evacuation. Clearly, though, such a mass effect would have to be exile or forced sacrifice or something - &quot;destroy&quot; is negated at the sacrifice of a single Escort.<br /><br />Also, the ability to simply willfully sacrifice is another element making the Escort so incredibly powerful. It's instantaneous and doesn't require even <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" /> as an additional cost. Just use the sac as a response to something - even if the Escort is already tapped, blocking, or blocked. Also, I don't think you can respond to Escort's sacrifice with any effect that's going to prevent Escort's effect, because Escort would not be in play to be affected; that is, sacrificing Escort is the activation to its ability. Therefore, once you sacrifice Escort, the ability is on the stack, and Escort is no longer in play to be affected. (Say I sacrifice Escort to activate his ability. My opponent wishes to respond by Bolting Escort. Escort is no longer there to be Bolted, and the Bolt either must be cast targeting a different creature, or must not be cast at all. Alternatively, say I sac the Escort to activate its ability. My opponent responds by casting <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rout\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rout\">Rout</a> as an instant. In this case, Rout's effect <b>would</b> actually resolve before Escort's ability takes effect. Hm. I hadn't thought of that, before. Pretty cool. Still, casting Rout as an instant requires what, 7 mana? That ain't easy, and isn't too likely to happen in the game of one-on-one Magic.)<br /><br />Just an amazing creature - and card.",
   "text_posted": "My experience of this guy is nearly the opposite of bowlofgumbo's (\"He seems good on paper, he really does. In reality this guy isn't that sick. Cool? Sure. Useful? A little. Game changing? Not really, no. 3.5\"). Basically, this creature is a sitting 'soak', or counter spell, for destruction magic.\n\nWhen I first looked at the card, I thought it could be nice and occasionally helpful, but would generally turn out to be not all that great. I've now played a number of games with a deck in which I have 4 Escorts, along with a number of other excellent and effective creatures. My experience is that, [b]so long as you have a bunch of other creatures in play of the type an opponent would want to destroy or remove as quickly as possible, alongside the Escort, Escort is by far worth much more than the three measly mana paid for it[/b]. It's a buffer for all of your other creatures for one turn; not one card - one turn. If you have more than one in play, the opponent just has to sit there and sigh, knowing that she or he must expend a number of destruction spells (even mass spells like [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard] and [autocard]Plague Wind[/autocard]) equal to the number of Escorts in play [b]before[/b] beginning to have an effect on creatures other than Dauntless Escort. If those destruction spells have mass effects (like Wrath), they must be expended on separate turns, taking more time and allowing more damage from the creatures being escorted. So, so powerful.\n\nThe only way to get around it is to use mass bounce like [autocard]Evacuation[/autocard] - then maybe counter it as it heads back out, since you're running Blue at that point. Otherwise, you've just gotta use your spells one-for-one on Escort (unless you've got some kind of awesome, repeatable ability on a permanent - maybe [autocard]Temporal Adept[/autocard], [autocard]Royal Assassin[/autocard], [autocard]Flameblast Dragon[/autocard]) before getting to the [b]other[/b] creatures in play - the ones you're [i]really[/i] after.\n\nI see a 5/5 rating as indicating perfection in a card. I'm not sure that any card printed after '94 deserves a 5 rating (examples would be [autocard]Mox Sapphire[/autocard] and [autocard]Black Lotus[/autocard]), though several cards [b]do[/b] warrant a 4.5 - such as [autocard]Counterspell[/autocard]. [b]I give Dauntless Escort a 4.5 of 5 rating. I feel that it's one of the very best creatures that a creature-driven deck could have in play.[/b] Having more than one in play at one time creates a nearly hopeless situation for a one-on-one opponent - at least, it's basically hopeless for a number of destruction spells played (and separate turns to play them) equal to the number of Escorts in play - or for a number of turns equal to the number of Escorts in play, if Wrath-like spells are the destruction at hand.\n\nIs there a card that 'exiles', say, target creature and all other creatures that share a color or name with target creature? That would really be the best way to deal with multiple Dauntless Escort cards in play - even better than the mass bounce like Evacuation. Clearly, though, such a mass effect would have to be exile or forced sacrifice or something - \"destroy\" is negated at the sacrifice of a single Escort.\n\nAlso, the ability to simply willfully sacrifice is another element making the Escort so incredibly powerful. It's instantaneous and doesn't require even [1] as an additional cost. Just use the sac as a response to something - even if the Escort is already tapped, blocking, or blocked. Also, I don't think you can respond to Escort's sacrifice with any effect that's going to prevent Escort's effect, because Escort would not be in play to be affected; that is, sacrificing Escort is the activation to its ability.

Even with Urabrask the Hidden and Hammer of Purphoros, thats 5 out of 99. Still slim, but much higher of a chance. I especially like it in my Prossh deck, since its specialty is 1/1 weenies swarming, stopping flyers. Then I suddenly drop a haste, drop Prossh, attack the open skies for 21 and win.

The next time state-based actions are checked, Shield of the Oversoul would go to your graveyard because Naya Hushblade is now an illegal object.\n\namirite?\n\nbrb downvoting all these comments\n\nP.S. \"illegal object\" made me think she must only be like 15 \"[/i]\nYou clearly do not understand the rules. She has shroud once the aura, (played on turn three) enters the battlefield. The Aura no longer targets her, so as long as you control no other multicolored permanents when casting it, it's perfectly fine otherwise [autocard]Robe of Mirrors[/autocard] and the like would have rules text, (or at the very least oracle text) akin to [autocard]White Ward[/autocard]. So no you are not \"rite,\" and are downvoting helpful comments that should be in top comments because they are informative.",

For jund colors you can use rise from the grave on the creature you just killed or even follow up with a vengeful rebirth, take creature and hit them with it, burn another creature with the vengeful rebirth for 5 while bringing back the slave of bolas, and then use it again.
