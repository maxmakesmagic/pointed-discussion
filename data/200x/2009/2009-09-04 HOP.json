If someone is playing white, then everyone else has strong incentive to roll the planar die, and if someone rolls chaos, then even the white player must eventually start rolling to get things moving forward.  As far as getting stuck here, most decks should have no trouble rolling the planar die 3 times per turn.  Two turns of this and there's only a 33% chance that you're still stuck here.  After the third turn, it drops below 20% and after the fourth turn it reaches 11%.  If more than one player is rolling three times, then this plane should be gone within two rounds.",

By itself, the Festering Goblin is able to take out a 2/2 creature or finish off a creature granting an extra -1/-1. Because the ability does not do damage, Festering Goblin can get rid of small regenerators like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge Skeletons\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Drudge Skeletons\">Drudge Skeletons</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Will-o'-the-Wisp\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Will-o'-the-Wisp\">Will-o'-the-Wisp</a>.

The main reason for this is that Festering Goblin requires another card or action to occur, such as death in combat, for the -1/-1 effect to take place. On top of that, Festering Goblin cannot be used to deal 1 damage directly to an opponent like the Fanatic can.

Very nice.

I’m not sure why these cards were so important--they were the only affinity cards that referenced anything other than artifacts in the entire block--but the <i>Darksteel </i>team was committed to printing them even once the problem with sunburst was explained. Personally, I’d have ditched the Golems to let the next set shine, as the Golems weren’t pulling a ton of weight anyway. But I’m biased.\r<br />\r<br />So players ended up drafting these powerful Golems highly and playing one- and two-color decks, and then had little interest in drafting sunburst in pack three, which made the set feel really tangential to the prior sets instead of integrated. And thus, block planning was born.\r<br />\r<br />Even now in R&amp;D, sunburst is kind of maligned, I think unfairly. Personally I think it can come back; it doesn’t even necessarily have to go on artifacts.\r<br />\r<br />I also think that if the recent change to drafting last-set-first was in effect during MD5, sunburst could have been a killer archetype and not something that you gambled/lucked your way into. <i>Fifth Dawn </i>was certainly on my mind as we discussed implementing that upcoming change.\r<br />\r<br />Oh, as for Suntouched Myr specifically, it was submitted at 2 mana.

I’m not sure why these cards were so important--they were the only affinity cards that referenced anything other than artifacts in the entire block--but the [i]Darksteel [/i]team was committed to printing them even once the problem with sunburst was explained. Personally, I’d have ditched the Golems to let the next set shine, as the Golems weren’t pulling a ton of weight anyway. But I’m biased.\r\n\r\nSo players ended up drafting these powerful Golems highly and playing one- and two-color decks, and then had little interest in drafting sunburst in pack three, which made the set feel really tangential to the prior sets instead of integrated. And thus, block planning was born.\r\n\r\nEven now in R&D, sunburst is kind of maligned, I think unfairly. Personally I think it can come back; it doesn’t even necessarily have to go on artifacts.\r\n\r\nI also think that if the recent change to drafting last-set-first was in effect during MD5, sunburst could have been a killer archetype and not something that you gambled/lucked your way into. [i]Fifth Dawn [/i]was certainly on my mind as we discussed implementing that upcoming change.\r\n\r\nOh, as for Suntouched Myr specifically, it was submitted at 2 mana. Both versions are interesting in limited.",

There aren't a huge number of White effects I can think of that you want to play at 2C, usually because instead White's going to be dropping big Wrath effects or playing a pinpoint removal spell for C, 1C, or CC. \n\n\nBlue: [autocard]Divination[/autocard]. In a lot of ways, Arc Lightning : Lightning Bolt as Divination :: Brainstorm. You would always rather have the older card, but the new card actually sometimes sees play even in competitive environments, and is a perfectly acceptable choice for casual or FNM. Less good in Draft.\n\nBlack: [autocard]Dark Banishing[/autocard] is the new and old standard for Black Removal, as [autocard]Doom Blade[/autocard] has been bumped to Uncommon status in the past couple years. Because of the Mullti-targeting thing, I think Arc Lightning is actually in a lot of situations better than Dark Banishing, and very specifically, in certain matchups, better than [autocard]Doom Blade[/autocard] (if you're playing against a weenie deck or a deck that plays Good Stuff but has a low Toughness average, and you're not looking to Axe a bomby [autocard]Tarmogoyf[/autocard] or something.\n\nRed: [autocard]Flames of the Firebrand[/autocard] is a modern card that Arc Lightning compares well to. That's fairly impressive TBH. Multi-targeting is just a really good thing. \n\nGreen: I don't really think it's possible to fairly compare Red Damage spells to Green [autocard]Naturalize[/autocard] effects. I think Fade Into Antiquity can Exile [autocard]God[/autocard]s, but...",

Count on using his ability either once a game or never, unless you are playing against some extremely jank casual decks.\r\n\r\n\"Weak for its cost? I wouldn't call this guy weak by any means; he's incredibly useful and he tactfully rounds out any Zombie tribal deck.\"\r\n\r\nANY zombie deck? Lemme guess... you run a deck with 16 lands, 4 of which are cabal coffers, to support this montrosity of a card and a full playset of Helldozers, amirite?\r\n\r\nBe careful in choosing your tribal bombs, ESPECIALLY in zombies -  where you will be consistently be forced to compete against opponents who use generally stronger decks. In the end this card is nothing better than a limited bomb that might win you the game if you plan on consistently playing games that last for 20 turns or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
