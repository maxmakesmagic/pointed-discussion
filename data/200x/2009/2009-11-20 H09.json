If a creature has Defender now, be it a wall or otherwise, it must specifically be listed in its text box. Thus, this and all Changling creatures (as well as the old mistform creatures) can now become walls without being automatically given the \"this creature cannot attack\" clause (namely, Defender).\n\nThey did the same thing when they removed the \"Legend\" creature type. It is now considered the supertype \"Legendary\", and creatures that were considered the type Legend are subsequently Legendary instead. (Done for reasons pertaining to Legendary lands, enchantments, and artifacts, to reduce confusion for players.)",

To aid us, I made a Pros/Cons list:<br /><br />PRO<br />- Sliver Legion is a Sliver itself, which can benefit from Sliver bonuses.<br />- It benefits from it's own ability and improves it, making it at least +1/+1 more effective than CoA.<br />- It can be played as an EDH general.<br />- It can be Tutor'ed with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver Overlord\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sliver Overlord\">Sliver Overlord</a> and/or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homing Sliver\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Homing Sliver\">Homing Sliver</a>.<br />- Sliver Legion helps only Slivers.
