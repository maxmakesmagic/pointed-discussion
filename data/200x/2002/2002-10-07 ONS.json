While I can not deny that this sounds great almost every zombie will be a power house with four warchiefs. If that is how you want to use this guy consider running a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=soulless one\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"soulless one\">soulless one</a> instead, even without ANY other zombies on the field or in the graveyard with 4 warchiefs this guy is a 13/9 for <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" />.\r<br />\r<br />But what makes Gravespawn Sovereign a great card is not his power/toughness. What makes his great is his ability to reanimate the best creatures that have gone to the graveyard. Here is where many people may misuse his ability. To use Gravespawn Sovereign to his full potential you must pay close attention to when you use his ability. Usally his ability is best suited for when your opponents are attacking and you need a blocker out of nowhere, or right before your upkeep. Keep in mind that creatures with summoning sickness may still be tapped to pay this cost (including himself). In general if you use his ability right before your upkeep you never leave your self open to attacks since your zombies are not tapped out.\r<br />\r<br />Like I said before I have a love hate relationship with this card. He is a strong card with a lot going for him, he is expensive for the body you get though, and he requires four other zombies under your control to even utalize his ability.\r<br />\r<br />He is not right for every zombie deck, I learned that the hard way. Many zombie decks will not have the resources to make this creature an allstar member of the cast, due to either low mana curves or creatures that fit the 6 drop slot better or maybe even due to splashing too many colors such as Grixis/Nightscape decks (though the latter is less likely since he is a 6 drop and only requires <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" />).\r<br />\r<br />All in all, if you use him, play him wisely.",

If you're running a pali/hightide infinite mana combo with a lib of leng in play and you drop a 60 (or whatever number of cards is left in your library) point <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=read the runes\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"read the runes\">read the runes</a>, does leng let you turn around and stack those cards in the order of your choosing right back into the library? and, presuming future sight is one of the cards you palm in this process, if you don't have it in play already, it would then let you conceivably play through your entire deck <i>exactly as you'd like</i> with all the land clumped on the bottom, which you wouldn't need anyway from the pali mana generator.<br /><br />It's a ridiculously complex combo, but assuming you built a deck around making that happen, you could then put literally any kind of ridiculous victory combo into action as long as you had the cards necessary somewhere in your deck, no matter how outrageous or otherwise unlikely to happen.

While this fellow would never see play in any sort of Standard environment (he's far, far too high of a CMC), it's still nice to see a Goblin Piledriver effect, especially for the criminally under-represented Beast tribe.  Not nearly enough synergy exists for tribal Beasts, in my opinion, and not only does this card provide some of that, but it's also red as opposed to the usual green.  Two-color tribal Beasts?  That's just plain wrong!  (And by wrong I mean awesome.)  Anyway, this creature has a lot of potential, but only in the right style of deck, likely a red-green tribal Beast beatdown with some ramp or perhaps a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonebrow, Krosan Hero\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Stonebrow, Krosan Hero\">Stonebrow, Krosan Hero</a> EDH deck with a Beast subtheme.  Otherwise, his very high CMC prevents him from seeing play very often.<br /><br />What I think I like most about this card, however, is the art.  Action poses are always fun to see on cards, especially when they're big, nasty creatures looking to beat your face in, and Mark Zug did a fine job of capturing this creature in a powerful pose.  I certainly wouldn't want to face down this guy on the battlefield any time soon.  The way his body looks as though it's melded with the rock is especially cool.  One thing does bother me, however:  Why aren't there other Beasts pictured alongside him?  His ability is dependent upon other Beasts for him to be powerful; seeing him run in there solo is nice and all, but I think it would've added a whole different layer of awesome to have him charging at the forefront of a cadre of angry Beasts.  Honestly, though, that's a very minor thing, and I won't let it detract me from enjoying the artwork we do have.<br /><br />FINAL RATING:  3/5",

The second gratuitous violence triggered on the 4 damage by the kavu, at the same time as first. So i think they dont stack, but i will check again.",
   "text_posted": "the card says 'instead'. I think 'instead' means the damage that would be dealt is replaced by double damage and then replaced again not by more damage but again by double damage. so flametongue kavu would deal 4 damage, both gratuitous violences trigger on it, but they both replace the 4 with 8. The second gratuitous violence triggered on the 4 damage by the kavu, at the same time as first. So i think they dont stack, but i will check again.",

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Good memories of this card. This, along with Krosan Cloudscraper of course, epitomize why I love morph. The first game that you play with an opponent, they WILL fall for the above trick and lose in a few subsequent turns to your insect hordes, and that's certainly fun. The second game, though, will be better because you can deploy a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scornful Egotist\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Scornful Egotist\">Scornful Egotist</a> face down and watch your opponent break off his attack immediately because the morph creature COULD be Broodhatch Nantuko. Morph enables mind games that put Magic at its most fun-to-play. 5/5.",

Its a blue 1/2 for [2], it has a protection that was very useful in block and remains relevant even now ([i]Probably the best there is outside of real, supported tribes[/i]), belongs to a major tribe himself, and has morph. He doesn't have a 'turned face-up' ability, but the idea is that you can surprise people with the protection ability.\n\nSo really, no, he isn't [autocard]Snapcaster Mage[/autocard], but he is a perfectly decent creature: middle of the road.\n\nI love the art too!",

By itself, the Festering Goblin is able to take out a 2/2 creature or finish off a creature granting an extra -1/-1. Because the ability does not do damage, Festering Goblin can get rid of small regenerators like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge Skeletons\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Drudge Skeletons\">Drudge Skeletons</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Will-o'-the-Wisp\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Will-o'-the-Wisp\">Will-o'-the-Wisp</a>. One <i>drawback</i> to this card is that the triggered ability is not optional. In other words, if your opponent has no creatures, he can destroy Festering Goblin in order to kill <b>two</b> of yours! In my <b>black</b>/<b>red</b> casual goblin deck, I try not to run goblins with a toughness of 1 that will be susceptible to this gruesome tactic, such as: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knucklebone Witch\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Knucklebone Witch\">Knucklebone Witch</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin Chirurgeon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Goblin Chirurgeon\">Goblin Chirurgeon</a>, etc. Even with the new change in rules from M10, Festering Goblin still is not as effecient as the &quot;all so famous&quot; <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg Fanatic\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mogg Fanatic\">Mogg Fanatic</a>. The main reason for this is that Festering Goblin requires another card or action to occur, such as death in combat, for the -1/-1 effect to take place. On top of that, Festering Goblin cannot be used to deal 1 damage directly to the opponent like the Fanatic can. If you are running red in your deck, use the slightly better version of this card: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin Arsonist\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Goblin Arsonist\">Goblin Arsonist</a>.
