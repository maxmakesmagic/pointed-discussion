Perfect example: say you have chainer out on you're field, and you're opponent is using a beefy green deck (my personal favorite) and you have 5 health left and just a little mana, they have 7 health left and a thorn elemental in their graveyard..a simple answer is to take the thorn, use Rite of Consumption to sacrifice it and deal 8 damage (because of the +1/+1 from chainer) and you just won the game with a total of 3 black and 3 health. Even better if this happens close to the beginning because while you may lose some life, the opposing player loses even more.",

Whenever you get a Narcomoeba, sac it to Goblin Bombardment immediately. When you mill an Eldrazi/Blessing, your graveyard, which includes the Narcomoebas you sacrificed, gets put back into your library. Eventually, you will have dealt 20 damage to your opponent.\n\nI have a feeling that this combo is really impractical for one reason or another, but whatever. I play casual, so it doesn't really matter to me.",

Your opponent will get colourless mana in an EDH game, and if they're not playing black, any chance of playing a coloured spell this turn is gone. It's like a [autocard]Blood moon[/autocard] for black on a stick.\n\nAdd in the fact he can give your creatures effectively swamp walk and is very cheap for his abilities, he's amazing! Of course he must be played in combination with other zombies, but if you can get a few zombies out by turn 3 or 4, and use his swamp making ability (after all, it's a force tap - haste not required!), then you could definitely set your opponents back several turns (without the life loss of an [autocard]Infernal Darkness[/autocard]). How this guys isn't more renown boggles me.\n\n5/5 all day erry day.",

   "text_parsed": "Lo and behold, I present... THE WORST CARD OF ALL TIME.<br /><br />Now, you may point out, stats wise, this isn't truly the worst creature in the game. Bramble Elemental is a less efficient win condition, and there are noncreature cards that have less use (this is still a highly efficient 20 turn clock with evasion!). But as to WHY this is truly the worst creature of all time, let me try and break this down.<br /><br />First, let's get it out of the way, it is very weak. 3W for a 1/1 flying is only marginally better than Chimney Imp, and that has a pretty sick death ability! The activatable ability is so overcosted that it is mostly irrelevent, but sure, you can sneak a few points of damage in. So this card is obviously weak to the point of being completely unplayable in every situation, but that is hardly unique, every set has a couple of those.<br /><br />Second, that ability. That ability tempts you. It gives you the promise of &quot;This guy won't just be a 1/1 flying for 4!&quot;. With Squire, you have no hope. You lay him down, and you know he'll be just as weak as he looks. Here, they taunt you by giving you a taste of power, but then make the ability so ridiculously overcosted in both cards and mana than it is unusable. In fact, the only time I could imagine activating the ability is if you had another Aven Trooper in hand to dump. Aven Trooper is also more recent than other contenders for worst creature of all time, sure those old Legends cards were overpriced, but they were from Legends! All those guys sucked! This creature was in the same block as efficient creatures like Nimble Mongoose, Basking Rootwalla and Ichorid, I thought WotC had figured out creatures by the Odyssey block?<br /><br />Third, the flavor/feel of the card. This is the crucial bit. Wood Elemental is a less efficient card stats wise. But, it works better as a card. It makes sense, you cast this Elemental, and he is literally the size of the forests he consumes when he enters play. Pretty flavorful! Most all time bad creatures have that going for them. let's examine Aven Trooper, creature type Aven Soldier. That's how boring this card is, his name is just his creature type with a synonym for the second bit. Imagine if there was just a card Goblin. Or Zombie. No, it's Raging Goblin, or Vengeful Zombie. Those extra words give the cards some nice flavor. This card is literally just a renaming of it's creature type. The creature itself in the art is about as uninspiring as an aven could be, and it is stuck on literally a white background.<br /><br />Now, along with this flavor, what the *** is that art. Is that even finished? What card has that much whitespace on it? Is that supposed to be the sky in the background? Because the sky isn't white. Where the *** is this bird? The flavor text while bad, is easily the highlight of the card. It resembles a sentence, and the word &quot;seethe&quot; is more interesting than the entire rest of the card.<br /><br />I honestly want to know what happened with this card. Was this some kind of weird twisted template of a card that made it to print? The mana cost is off by about a factor of 4 (and even then the ability would be negligible), it is just a bird soldier, named as such, even the art is unfinished. So again, I present the worst card in Magic the Gathering history. It is the rare card that fails on every conceivable level. In that way, there is a certain beauty to it. A two year old, randomly hitting buttons on a card generator, would invariably make a more interesting card. This card is so forgettable that it sticks with you. It is truly a remarkable feat.",
