Skip your draw phase to Dredge and Balthor hits the board on turn 2 with a Cabal Ritual. Another dark ritual with the remaining 1 mana then allows you to play his ability the same turn!!!! Potentially 7 big creatures hit the board on turn 2. Works great later in the game with Painter's Servant, Bojuka Bog and any large scale creature removal too :D\n\nAlso @ God_of_Slivers, I like the sound of morality shift, I think you just helped me finish a deck.",

Could definitely work great with the insect horrors of M11 and Mirrodin. Another awesome thing would be Green Blue Ravnica and those silly tech elves.",

   "text_parsed": "@gabriel: All 4 dragons enter at the same time, which puts all 4 of their first abilities on the stack in whatever order you prefer (it doesn't matter). The first of 4 abilities go off, exiling all but one worldgorger. This triggers the second ability of all 3 exiled worldgorgers, which return nothing since their first ability hasn't gone off yet. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to start naming worldgorgers by letters, A, B, C, and D. A will be the worldgorger currently alone on the field, while B, C, and D are the ones in exile.<br /><br />The 'return to play' abilities of B, C, and D, all fizzle, since they never exiled anything in the first place. However, you still have the exiling abilities of B, C, and D, on the stack. Resolving the ability of B removes A from the battlefield, which triggers A's final ability, returning everything to the field, including B, C, and D. This triggers the exiling abilities of B, C, and D, which puts all 3 of them on the stack, again. Say you choose to resolve B first. <br /><br />B exiled A previously, so C and D would be removed from the field, returning A. This puts A's exiling ability on the stack, as well as C and D's returning ability, however those last two abilities fizzle as nothing was exiled. Thus, A's exiling ability resolves first, removing B from the field. When B leaves, it returns C and D, as well as everything else you controlled.<br /><br />This triggers C and D's exiling ability. Resolving C then exiles everything, including A. Removing A returns B to the field, triggering B's exiling ability, removing C from the field. C's last ability triggers, returning A and everything else to the field.

   "text_posted": "@gabriel: All 4 dragons enter at the same time, which puts all 4 of their first abilities on the stack in whatever order you prefer (it doesn't matter). The first of 4 abilities go off, exiling all but one worldgorger. This triggers the second ability of all 3 exiled worldgorgers, which return nothing since their first ability hasn't gone off yet. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to start naming worldgorgers by letters, A, B, C, and D. A will be the worldgorger currently alone on the field, while B, C, and D are the ones in exile.\n\nThe 'return to play' abilities of B, C, and D, all fizzle, since they never exiled anything in the first place. However, you still have the exiling abilities of B, C, and D, on the stack. Resolving the ability of B removes A from the battlefield, which triggers A's final ability, returning everything to the field, including B, C, and D. This triggers the exiling abilities of B, C, and D, which puts all 3 of them on the stack, again. Say you choose to resolve B first. \n\nB exiled A previously, so C and D would be removed from the field, returning A. This puts A's exiling ability on the stack, as well as C and D's returning ability, however those last two abilities fizzle as nothing was exiled. Thus, A's exiling ability resolves first, removing B from the field. When B leaves, it returns C and D, as well as everything else you controlled.\n\nThis triggers C and D's exiling ability. Resolving C then exiles everything, including A. Removing A returns B to the field, triggering B's exiling ability, removing C from the field. C's last ability triggers, returning A and everything else to the field. A then triggers again, exiling everything, causing B to be removed but C to re-enter.\n\nAt this point, you've reached an infinite loop. C will exile A, returning B. B then exiles C, returning A. A then exiles B, returning C. Thus, C re-enters, exiling A and returning B, starting that loop over again. You can further complicate things by resolving D at some point, but the end result is the same, an infinite loop of triggers triggering other triggers.\n\nThis would cause the game to end in a draw.

Too much of the other stuff felt more \"rare\" than this.\r\n\r\nFor what it’s worth, we’ve cut back considerably on how often we make goofball red enchantments like this in recent years. I know there’s a crowd that enjoys them, but they don’t need one or more per set!",

I mean, we're getting 3/4's and 4/5's for three, now, without any drawback (albiet in triple-green, but not that mana-fixing ever mattered when you're running green). I really like this card.

Chances are your foes will catch up on the removal quickly (considering how cheap it usually is) if they're playing control, or they will have a stable enough position by turn four that Mister Clean will not be such a big deal (especially if you're playing against Jund/Zoo/Fae).\r<br />\r<br />Edit: In response Omenchild's comment, I make the following clarifications (you're still on the stack).\r<br />\r<br />I don't doubt that it's a good card. Please don't misunderstand- I know it was a staple in it's day, and I like the card a great deal. It is not, and I repeat, NOT unplayable. Nor do I expect cards to be of mythic rare quality. I simply mean to say that it's been outcompeted. Casually, you could run this in a non-forest deck and get a 4/5 for four with no drawback. You could combine it, as Fivefiftyseven has mentioned, with defender-granting cards, negating the drawback. It is a solid creature ahead of the curve. What I'm saying is that I could play something like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon Colossus \" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Chameleon Colossus \">Chameleon Colossus </a> or<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfbriar Elemental\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wolfbriar Elemental\">Wolfbriar Elemental</a> and get a benefit rather than a drawback for one less toughness. Or, at uncommon, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporesower Thallid\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sporesower Thallid\">Sporesower Thallid</a> or others that are less directly comparable. I don't have to play around a drawback with them. This was run in agro decks. You can't deny there have been better cards for that strategy since. That's not to say I LIKE that fact- I consider this card well balanced.\r<br />\r<br />As for Vintage, you are completely correct. You're right, of course- it's dominated by things such as hand disruption, land destruction, draw-go, and other things that are less creature intensive. The modern focus has shifted dramatically from good instants, sorceries, and enchantments to creatures. This is obvious. And in doing so, the pendulum has shifted past cards like this (and it's 5/5 for 2BB bretherin, which was not played at all when it's spiritual reprint came out), which were once impressively past the curve, on to something else. Which is exactly my point. Creatures have been redefined, and it will reach a point where they are the most efficient for their colour. Then, maybe, other spells can be redefined so we need not be focused on creatures (spells other than mere creature removal, of course). I have every confidence that it will balance itself. But in the meantime- in the creature dominated formats of Standard and Extended, there are better 4-drops in green. In Vintage, an aggressive card like this wouldn't be played at all, demolished by Stasis and Necropotence decks. It's doomed to be locked in an unfortunate limbo between formats- a good card that doesn't have any space to be played in. \r<br />\r<br />My apologies for the length of that.

Usually other similar cards request at least 2 green specific mana to be cast or have much greater penalties. It still makes an advantage on slim decks that aim to cast spells quickly.<br />This card is somehow obsolete but you can still build decks on it and it can still be fearsome, as you have already explained here, in decks without any forest land or in ones that can negate its malus with a good playing strategy<br />I'm 34 now, but there was a time when we used Erhnam Djinn to kill creatures with the ability that is the opposite of Shroud (dies instantly when the target of spells or effects) as Skulking Ghost or Tarpit Warrior.<br /><br />When it was released, I always thought that it was unfair for green to have a creature overall weaker than Juzam Djinn (4/5 for the color that should be the master of big creatures? Nonsense) and it was extremely hard to use it competitively in mono-green decks, since there were few valid alternatives. We also used Armageddon with Zuran's Orb to keep its penalty under control. Also, it was terrible when you couldn't attack nor block for strategic reasons, or it was locked by a pacifism or similar, but it was granting a free opening to the opponent as well, leaving you with a bunch of turns to win or die. Nowadays, even if there are better creatures, I think that it is more powerful than the past for the real possibility of creating a land with no forests. :)",
