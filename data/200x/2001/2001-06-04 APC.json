When you just want to kill a creature, it's exactly as efficient as any other red X spell, requiring only one colored mana in addition to the X value. At the same time, the card gets much more efficient in the late game, where every single mana spent for X translates into one damage to a creature, one card drawn, and one damage to a player. <br /><br />For example, play a 13 mana illuminate with all kickers in a late Commander game. X is then 5. A five damage blaze to a creature would cost normally six mana. A five damage blaze to a player would also cost six. A five card brain geyser would cost seven mana. That would cost together 19 mana, instead of 13. In addition, you'd have to spend three cards for these effects, instead of one, so to come out with the same card advantage, you'd have to cast a 9 mana braingeyser, ending up with a total cost of 21 mana, instead of 13. AND the mana cost would require four colored mana, instead of three on illuminate. AND it would take up three card slots in your deck, instead of one.",

Mythic Rares and Planeswalkers just in general increase the power Creatures have to be at for Standard to be OK (If the Creatures didn't wreck people, the Planeswalker Deck would flat out replace the card type). \n\n\nI'm trying to imagine any scenario in which Wizards would let you play with 20 Lands, 30 multicolored cards ranging in mana costs from 4 to 8, and a spell suite designed to force this card onto the battlefield ASAP. No, I don't think so. This card would have make [autocard]Diabolic Tutor[/autocard] playable in Standard. It would have been awkward to make the deck fully work, but it would have been probably way WAY more powerful than [autocard]Maze's End[/autocard].\n\n\nJust.....no people.

However, you MUST do this every time he does damage, including when he's blocked, so more often than not you'll be able to get a point of life loss out even if he is blocked - so as long as you get off one attack, you are basically guaranteed one point of life loss.  An interesting creature, but there are many better, more reliable creatures.  It does however, have several relevant creature types - the addition of Warrior means he can now wield <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian Battle-Axe\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Obsidian Battle-Axe\">Obsidian Battle-Axe</a> too.  He can also come into play off of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preeminent Captain\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Preeminent Captain\">Preeminent Captain</a> attacks.

However, you MUST do this every time he does damage, including when he's blocked, so more often than not you'll be able to get a point of life loss out even if he is blocked - so as long as you get off one attack, you are basically guaranteed one point of life loss.  An interesting creature, but there are many better, more reliable creatures.  It does however, have several relevant creature types - the addition of Warrior means he can now wield [autocard]Obsidian Battle-Axe[/autocard] too.  He can also come into play off of [autocard]Preeminent Captain[/autocard] attacks.  As with all black/white creatures, a good target for [autocard]Edge of the Divinity[/autocard].  An interesting card with a unique ability that makes you think a little more than most commons, and with such a unique set of creature types.\n\nBy the way, if you're a fan of black/white common lifegain off of combat damage, you might like [autocard]Mourning Thrull[/autocard] as well.",

This could certainly be a component, alongside many of the [mc]UW[/mc] cards mentioned on this page, in a [mc]RWU[mc] control deck, with several enchantments that ping off your opponent's creatures. Sadly, the only other card I could suggest would be [autocard]Magmatic Core[/autocard]. But if you toss in some [autocard]Enlightened Tutor[/autocard]s and [autocard]Idyllic Tutor[/autocard], this deck could work in Casual. Seems like enchantments that uncontrollably attack creatures is some unexplored design space for R&D to look at. I'd bet on an [autocard]Ajani's Mantra[/autocard]-esque card in a Core Set at some point.",

So, what is your point? (Yes, I have repeated myself)\r\nDon't mean to be rude, but seriously, people like you for example point out the ovious in how to get rid of a creature. Not about how to get rid of any creature, it's how to get the most out of it while/when using it.",

Nah, I'll just redraw and replay him for 5 mana next turn, thank you very much...<br /><br />     What may be slightly less obvious is how rainbow Cromat gives you access to cards of all colors.  This is a big deal in EDH- there's no card in MTG that you aren't allowed to play with Cromat as your commander.

You also have access to charms and multi-part cards, helping you to do everything all the time.  And you can use cool rainbow stuff like the Bringers.  Also the stuff that makes a creature better the more colors it is become pretty great... hello <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessing of the Nephilim\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Blessing of the Nephilim\">Blessing of the Nephilim</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might of the Nephilim\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Might of the Nephilim\">Might of the Nephilim</a>, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight of New Alara\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Knight of New Alara\">Knight of New Alara</a>!  Cards like that and double strike and extra attack phase stuff can allow you to deal that 21 commander damage in a turn, and do so without giving yourself away beforehand.<br /><br />    Cromat is fun!  He can do everything and he allows you to build a deck that can also do everything.  Also he's goofy, which in my book is a huge plus.  So that's the good.  Now the bad.  First, lands.  Figuring out what lands you need for rainbow EDH is a headache.  And if you choose to buy lands for the deck, that can quickly become expensive as nonbasic lands can be pricey.  Personally, I like the Alara cycle and painlands.  Those will still be sort of costly, but nothing like stuffing your deck with, say, shock lands.  But if you're on a budget tap lands like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kazandu Refuge \" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kazandu Refuge \">Kazandu Refuge </a>should be ok.<br />    <br />    Second, figuring out how you use the mana in the deck can also be a pain.  Cromat has five abilities and each one requires different combinations of mana.  You're also playing cards of every color.  Figuring out what lands you need to use and how to use them, as well as what lands you need to leave open at any given time, can be a headache at first- it takes a little practice.  <br /><br />    Third, land kill can be a BIG problem for rainbow decks...<br />   <br />    I'm not sure Cromat would be a great EDH general for someone new to MTG or even to the EDH format.

   "text_parsed": "@guy before me without a real name cuz it's all numbers and jank jankety jank jank:<br />From the Vault is not JUST about broken cards. It's about powerful Nostalgia for the game of Magic. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan Dragon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Shivan Dragon\">Shivan Dragon</a> is one of the greatest hits in the history of the game- it's Alpha version is worth over 4 1st Edition Charizards because MAGIC is (minimum) a 4x Better Game than Pokemon. While it's true that From the Vault should not read like a &quot;Savor the Flavor&quot; laundry list (Ironically, From the Vault Legends- looking at you) of a bunch of Vorthos-tastic cards that have no real value, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Progenitus\">Progenitus</a>, unlike <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cromat\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Cromat\">Cromat</a>, is a much more recent card, much more powerful, and priveledged to be a good candidate for a Duel Decks or Modern Masters release. Cromat will have no such opportunities. Even if &quot;Scars of Dominaria&quot; or &quot;Return to Terisiare&quot; were to happen, Cromat will be forgotten. From the Vault is also a home for cards that can be printed no-where else for whatever reason. There will be no more Cromats now. A moment of silence for Cromat...<br /><br />Cromat is from the bygone days of Magic, when things like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird Ape\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kird Ape\">Kird Ape</a> were considered so fantastic they'd get Banned. There was only likely going to be one 5-color Legend in the Vault, and the choices were:<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion of the Ur-Dragon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Scion of the Ur-Dragon\">Scion of the Ur-Dragon</a><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sliver\">Sliver</a> something<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Progenitus\">Progenitus</a><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child of Alara\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Child of Alara\">Child of Alara</a><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cromat\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Cromat\">Cromat</a><br />I do believe that's every 5-colored Legendary Creature in Magic. Slivers already had their Premium Deck, and Sliver Queen I think is Reserved. Child of Alara while exactly the kind of card that could be considered if you only think about &quot;Tier 1 Zur, Azami and Friends&quot;, because it's Wrath-Power is good for play value, it really isn't anywhere as Exciting as Progenitus from the previous set. Progenitus is THE card for both power AND Vorthos from Alara, and indeed compares well to Emrakul and other WHOAH cards for Power./<br /><br />As a History Major, I like studying the past, and that includes Magic's Past, I think I know just what the Vault is supposed to be: A combination of what appeals to the kind of person that absolutely CRIES for the 90's Cartoons, for 10cent comic books, for Classical Music like Beethoven, for when War was Glorious like at Troy, and for all the Cool Things that are Gone Now, or that Whippersnappers Don't Appreciate, AND some seriously overpowered Jank that will make an awesome Commander Deck, ONCE, until your friends threaten to take you out behind the barn and shoot and stab and choke you, repeatedly, if you don't take it apart and scatter the pieces into various less-degenerate decks, never to be united again./Kird Ape and Shivan Dragon are JUST what 'filler' should look like in the Vault: Something that at least some people know the Epic Stories about, even if those stories are 'outdated'. You think that Cromat is completely stupid. Would you say the same thing to <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver Queen\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sliver Queen\">Sliver Queen</a>? She is a 5-color Legend that doesn't appear to have any redeeming qualities besides being 5-colors, and being very old, because honestly Allies decks can do very much what Slivers decks can, and those decks are really only a threat to decks that have no <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath of Gods\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wrath of Gods\">Wrath of Gods</a> nor anything like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle of Fire\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Circle of Fire\">Circle of Fire</a>.

   "text_posted": "@guy before me without a real name cuz it's all numbers and jank jankety jank jank:\nFrom the Vault is not JUST about broken cards. It's about powerful Nostalgia for the game of Magic. [autocard]Shivan Dragon[/autocard] is one of the greatest hits in the history of the game- it's Alpha version is worth over 4 1st Edition Charizards because MAGIC is (minimum) a 4x Better Game than Pokemon. While it's true that From the Vault should not read like a \"Savor the Flavor\" laundry list (Ironically, From the Vault Legends- looking at you) of a bunch of Vorthos-tastic cards that have no real value, [autocard]Progenitus[/autocard], unlike [autocard]Cromat[/autocard], is a much more recent card, much more powerful, and priveledged to be a good candidate for a Duel Decks or Modern Masters release. Cromat will have no such opportunities. Even if \"Scars of Dominaria\" or \"Return to Terisiare\" were to happen, Cromat will be forgotten. From the Vault is also a home for cards that can be printed no-where else for whatever reason. There will be no more Cromats now. A moment of silence for Cromat...\n\nCromat is from the bygone days of Magic, when things like [autocard]Kird Ape[/autocard] were considered so fantastic they'd get Banned. There was only likely going to be one 5-color Legend in the Vault, and the choices were:\n[autocard]Scion of the Ur-Dragon[/autocard]\n[autocard]Sliver[/autocard] something\n[autocard]Progenitus[/autocard]\n[autocard]Child of Alara[/autocard]\n[autocard]Cromat[/autocard]\nI do believe that's every 5-colored Legendary Creature in Magic. Slivers already had their Premium Deck, and Sliver Queen I think is Reserved. Child of Alara while exactly the kind of card that could be considered if you only think about \"Tier 1 Zur, Azami and Friends\", because it's Wrath-Power is good for play value, it really isn't anywhere as Exciting as Progenitus from the previous set. Progenitus is THE card for both power AND Vorthos from Alara, and indeed compares well to Emrakul and other WHOAH cards for Power./\n\nAs a History Major, I like studying the past, and that includes Magic's Past, I think I know just what the Vault is supposed to be: A combination of what appeals to the kind of person that absolutely CRIES for the 90's Cartoons, for 10cent comic books, for Classical Music like Beethoven, for when War was Glorious like at Troy, and for all the Cool Things that are Gone Now, or that Whippersnappers Don't Appreciate, AND some seriously overpowered Jank that will make an awesome Commander Deck, ONCE, until your friends threaten to take you out behind the barn and shoot and stab and choke you, repeatedly, if you don't take it apart and scatter the pieces into various less-degenerate decks, never to be united again./Kird Ape and Shivan Dragon are JUST what 'filler' should look like in the Vault: Something that at least some people know the Epic Stories about, even if those stories are 'outdated'. You think that Cromat is completely stupid. Would you say the same thing to [autocard]Sliver Queen[/autocard]? She is a 5-color Legend that doesn't appear to have any redeeming qualities besides being 5-colors, and being very old, because honestly Allies decks can do very much what Slivers decks can, and those decks are really only a threat to decks that have no [autocard]Wrath of Gods[/autocard] nor anything like [autocard]Circle of Fire[/autocard]. In other words, Slivers are TERRIBLE AWFUL MONSTERS when you don't come prepared, and when you do prepare....well, they aren't winning any Legacy Tournaments for a reason.  But Sliver Queen and Cromat actually have reasonably good play in Commander, AND appeal to exactly the players that [autocard]Shivan Dragon[/autocard] and [autocard]Kird Ape[/autocard] do (no, not RDW), and frankly, From the Vault Legends is highly critized for having too many recent cards and kind of reinforcing the reminder that Power Creep will make practically EVERY not-banned-in Legacy card become outdated and lackluster given enough time.
