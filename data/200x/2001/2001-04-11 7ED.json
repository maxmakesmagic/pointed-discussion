   "text_posted": "What surprises me most about this card is that it's so much worse than [autocard]Icy Manipulator[/autocard]. Despite being a 2/2 creature  - a trait often considered a handicap - and costing colored mana, the card still has a [2][G] \"tax\" on its activated ability relative to Icy Manipluator's [1] cost. The tax is most likely because Elder Druid is green and the ability is uncharacteristic of a green card. However, if you really want to use the tap ability, Icy Manipulator is a significantly better option at the same mana cost.",

   "text_posted": "50th Vote! :D\n\nThis is such an iconic spell that it still retains a 4.95 average on Gatherer, making it one of the very highest rated cards ever. Type in \"Rating > 4.95\", and the results will fit nearly on one page. All the other ones tend to be \"Laundry List\" cards that you see all the time in Vintage, sometimes in Legacy if they aren't BANNED, and NEVER anywhere else because they're too old. This has a directly functional reprint in [autocard]Day of Judgement[/autocard] and we get to play with it in Standard all the time. Probably the most powerful card, on average, that you or any of your friends own, unless you're a big collector that does history on \"Broken Stuff that Made History\".",

   "text_posted": "I hate this card with the passion of a thousand fiery suns.\n\nWhy? Because any new player who reads it immediately gets it in their head that Magic is a game of Slapjack.\n\nEvery time I see a new player use this card, here's how it's used:\n(1) I have priority, and tap down to cast whatever spell.\n(2) They wait until right before I show the spell from my hand, looking ready to pounce.\n(3) They superquick tap three islands and [b]BAM![/b] they Mana Short me.\n(4) I explain, sorry but that's not how the flow of the game proceeds, you don't have priority, you can't cast spells in response to mana abilities, etc -- Magic doesn't work that way, it's not a speedy-play contest.\n(5) They frown and go rebuild their deck, and this is the first card to go.\n\n...I sympathize with the new players on this. The card was confusing in its original form, and it's still confusing nowadays with the revised wording. It almost seems [i]designed[/i] to trick new players. I'm glad they eventually booted it from the core sets.",

   "text_parsed": "I love this card. Yes, it takes some of the thinking out of combat, but that's what it's supposed to do. Most of your creatures (in red/x or monored aggro) don't want to block. It's called the 'redzone' for a reason. It provides you with fantastic reach once the control deck has gotten out its wincon, or other decks have creatures out and believe themselves to have stabilized. I love it because your opponent's board presence no longer matters, what matters is who has the faster clock (hint: it's red). Furthermore it's such an unexpected effect that it often just comes out of left field so to speak.<br /><br />Your opponent feels safe and ready to move into a midgame where their bigger creatures and better value cards will get the game for them after your initial onslaught.

   "text_posted": "I love this card. Yes, it takes some of the thinking out of combat, but that's what it's supposed to do. Most of your creatures (in red/x or monored aggro) don't want to block. It's called the 'redzone' for a reason. It provides you with fantastic reach once the control deck has gotten out its wincon, or other decks have creatures out and believe themselves to have stabilized.
