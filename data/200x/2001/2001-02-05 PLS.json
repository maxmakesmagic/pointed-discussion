The only downside to Ertai is that if your not playing tokens or lost of enchantments then it can become quite difficult to use him effectively.

Why on earth would you ever choose the extremely limited -2 ability over a counterspell, which is the most powerful effect in the game.  Would you rather kill a 2/2 bear or counter a Darksteel Colossus?  \n\nOk the lifegain may be necessary to get one more chance to topdeck, but charms are silly because even though they offer utility, the abilities are so uneven its not worth the 3 color cost.",

   "text_posted": "@Bigg_ol & WrathofShane\nReiver says you must \"cast\" him, this says \"put into play.\" There's a reason the restriction the demon exists.\n\nThere is no combo with Reiver demon, and there *are* viritually no combos with him except mana ramp. Take this from a guy who puts demons into any deck that runs black. \n\n\nThe reason this isn't \"broken\" and merely \"good\" are:\n-It doesn't cause the creature to die, which is a coveted trigger (think [autocard]Flash[/autocard] [autocard]Hulk[/autocard] decks), Flash does do that\n-This doesn't cost 2 mana. 4 is quite reasonable for this considering that the best you'll ever get is a Wrath effect, but that costs 4 mana anyway. (Note: [autocard]Sunblast Angel[/autocard] makes an excellent combo with this)\n-This opens you up for easy two-for-ones. While it has potential to be card neutral, if the opponent has removal ready or his own combat trick you may just spend two cards to have the opponent spend one and save his creature anyway.\n-This can't be used offensively. At all. Even with Haste. Sad times :( :( :(\n\n",

Phelddagrif with pemmin's aura (so it actually IS a stronger morphling) is also really awesome, if mostly pointless.\n\nNot surprisingly, it's also one of the coolest cards you can ever cast in a multiplayer game.  People love these hippo tokens, and anyone who doesn't has no soul.  Therefor, you get people doing favors for you in hopes that they can get some free hippos or life-gain, or even card draws while you smash someone elses faces in with your super awesome flying hippo.  It's like a slightly worse morphling, but also better since it's a frickin' hippo with wings.",
