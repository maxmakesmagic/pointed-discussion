   "text_parsed": "Flame Burst and Kindle:<br /><br />In terms of raw damage, Lightning Bolt is far more efficient mana wise. In terms of card advantage though, Kindle shines better late game. In late game when bigger creatures come out, Lightning Bolt by itself may not be able to kill as well. Any creature with more than 3 toughness cannot be one-shot by Lightning Bolt later on, whereas Kindle can kill 4~5 toughness creatures at 1-1 exchange. In late game Kindle also hurts more when targeting your opponent. I think Lightning Bolt still wins out overall but Kindle is certainly a solid card.",

The other two just double the damage, which gets crazy.  6 to the creature, 10 to the player, or if Repercussion is in play as well, 6 to the creature, 12 to the player, or 10 to the player.  All for [R].\n\nYes, the opposing player gets to choose.  Yes, giving them the choice sucks.  Just be sure you can use it to your advantage.  Always target something they consider critical; mana creatures like [autocard]Noble Hierarch[/autocard], or something they might need for a combo.  Or something you KNOW is going to hurt you hard-core later.",

Typically you would[autocard] Armageddon[/autocard] w/ a[autocard] Dingus Egg[/autocard] out, sending all lands to the GY taking 2 for each land and subsequently screw yourself. Now, I could cast [autocard]Reverse Damage[/autocard], or[autocard] Circle Of Protection: Artifact[/autocard] or some garbage, right? If it's countered though, S.O.L huh?\n\nNot anymore.\nIf you're behind on life, and your ultimate goal is to possibly cause all involved a heap o' damage, you lose. Well my friends, that's the biggest PITA about Land Destruction. This card allows me to gain 4 life just before resolution of the Armageddon, thus off-setting the damage of up 2 lands going to my GY.",

There are plenty of sinister black creatures, but nobody, I mean NOBODY in black seems to ENJOY being evil as much as Braids here does.\n\nFor that reason alone, I will pick Braids, Cabal Minion over [autocard]Braids, Conjurer Adept[/autocard] any time. Conjurer adept just looks so... sad. Must be from missing out on all that black mana. I guess some people were just born to massacre.",

You could use non-storm cards to do this as well, such as [autocard]Sorin's Vengeance[/autocard].\n\nFor convenience:\n-[autocard]Cabal Ritual[/autocard]\n-[autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard]\n-[autocard]Culling the Weak[/autocard]\n-[autocard]Cloud of Faeries[/autocard]\n\nMaybes:\n-[autocard]Songs of the Damned[/autocard]\n-[autocard]Rain of Filth[/autocard]\n\n",

   "text_parsed": "First, rarity is honestly irrelevant to 'strictly' arguments, as are unusual formats. It's a direct comparison between the gameplay aspects of the cards. It's like saying a plains is better than a black lotus because plains are easier to obtain. As for formats like Pauper and EDH, I don't see why they should be counted because they start as house rules and anyone can make a format where a card might be better than it would be otherwise. I can create my own format where the only extra rule is cards you cast must have a minimum cmc of 7. Does this unusual format make a lightning bolt that costs RRRRRRR not strictly worse than a regular Lightning Bolt?<br /><br />Second, this card is still not strictly worse than Flame Javelin or Flame Sash. It's automatically invalidated from being strictly worse because it has flashback, and as ridiculous as that flashback cost may be it might be useful 1 in 50 games and is thus not STRICTLY worse. There's also a second thing for each of those cards that makes it not strictly worse - Flame Javelin is more colour intensive, costing RRR or 2RR rather than 3R, and Flame Sash targets creatures rather than players. Both are SIGNIFICANTLY better, but not STRICTLY better. For strictly better, see Lightning Bolt vs. Shock or Lightning Bolt vs. Shock, or Counterspell vs. Cancel. Stuff like that.<br /><br />Just my two cents on using strictly better the wrong way.",

It's like saying a plains is better than a black lotus because plains are easier to obtain. As for formats like Pauper and EDH, I don't see why they should be counted because they start as house rules and anyone can make a format where a card might be better than it would be otherwise. I can create my own format where the only extra rule is cards you cast must have a minimum cmc of 7. Does this unusual format make a lightning bolt that costs RRRRRRR not strictly worse than a regular Lightning Bolt?\n\nSecond, this card is still not strictly worse than Flame Javelin or Flame Sash. It's automatically invalidated from being strictly worse because it has flashback, and as ridiculous as that flashback cost may be it might be useful 1 in 50 games and is thus not STRICTLY worse. There's also a second thing for each of those cards that makes it not strictly worse - Flame Javelin is more colour intensive, costing RRR or 2RR rather than 3R, and Flame Sash targets creatures rather than players. Both are SIGNIFICANTLY better, but not STRICTLY better. For strictly better, see Lightning Bolt vs. Shock or Lightning Bolt vs. Shock, or Counterspell vs. Cancel. Stuff like that.\n\nJust my two cents on using strictly better the wrong way.",

Usually Shamans.<br />- <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurids\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Anurids\">Anurids</a>: Same again. Originally Beasts, now more fittingly Frog Beasts.<br />- <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Loxodon\">Loxodon</a>: Elephants. Thick-skinned Soldiers and Clerics from Mirrodin.<br />- <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Leonin\">Leonin</a>: Cats.

The infamous <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homarid\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Homarid\">Homarid</a>s. They first showed up in Fallen Empires, so them having a seperate type comes as little surprise. Wizards might simply kept that type for fun because of its special status, considering the infamy it gathered that even resulted in a whole new type in Unglued that's based on them: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5763\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"5763\">Clamfolk</a>.<br />2. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Viashino\">Viashino</a>: Although their first major appearance was in Urza Block, they first showed up <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3707\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3707\">in Visions</a>.<br />Which is another old set that still cared <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3623\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3623\">very</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3678\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3678\">little</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3622\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3622\">about</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3665\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3665\">creating</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3631\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3631\">overly</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3667\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3667\">specific</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3669\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3669\">creature</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3628\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3628\">types</a>.<br />Oh, wait.

So, err... if anything, this makes my point even more obvious, doesn't it?<br />I bet if this race would have first shown up in Ravnica Block (maybe even Urza Block), they would've just been Lizards (or Dragon Lizards, see my comment <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3471\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"3471\">here</a> for details).<br /><br />Obviously i'm not the one to decide that stuff, but it just seems logical to either give <i>all</i> or <i>none</i> of these animal-based humanoids a unique type.<br /><br /><b><u>TL;DR</u></b>: Since (to the enjoyment of every tribal fanatic) about 90% of humanoid animal species went for the animal's type, i'd really like a type change for those who did not.",

The most extreme example, sharing less traits with its actual species than Cephalids.\n\nThe only other exception i can think of are:\n1. The infamous [autocard]Homarid[/autocard]s. They first showed up in Fallen Empires, so them having a seperate type comes as little surprise. Wizards might simply kept that type for fun because of its special status, considering the infamy it gathered that even resulted in a whole new type in Unglued that's based on them: [autocard multiverseid=\"5763\"]Clamfolk[/autocard].\n2. [autocard]Viashino[/autocard]: Although their first major appearance was in Urza Block, they first showed up [autocard multiverseid=\"3707\"]in Visions[/autocard].\nWhich is another old set that still cared [autocard multiverseid=\"3623\"]very[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"3678\"]little[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"3622\"]about[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"3665\"]creating[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"3631\"]overly[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"3667\"]specific[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"3669\"]creature[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"3628\"]types[/autocard].\nOh, wait. Actually [autocard]Viashino Warrior[/autocard] is even older, which first showed up in Mirage, the expansion right before Visions. So, err... if anything, this makes my point even more obvious, doesn't it?\nI bet if this race would have first shown up in Ravnica Block (maybe even Urza Block), they would've just been Lizards (or Dragon Lizards, see my comment [autocard multiverseid=\"3471\"]here[/autocard] for details).\n\nObviously i'm not the one to decide that stuff, but it just seems logical to either give [i]all[/i] or [i]none[/i] of these animal-based humanoids a unique type.\n\n[b][u]TL;DR[/u][/b]: Since (to the enjoyment of every tribal fanatic) about 90% of humanoid animal species went for the animal's type, i'd really like a type change for those who did not.",
