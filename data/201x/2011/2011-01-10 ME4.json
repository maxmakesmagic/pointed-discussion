I lay this, say done, and during your turn, I use it to draw an 8th card. I then take my turn, draw up card #9, play a land, now have 8 cards, maybe a spell for 7 (Zuran Orb for Example) and then tap it AGAIN to draw ANOTHER card, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis card alone + Mind Twist were considered a Win in Type 1 back in 1994, AND 1995. They weren't Restricted then, and neither was Fastbond, so, you'd lay Fastbond, lay out 4 of these, cast Wheel of Fortune, and then tap all 4 in response to each other, and draw 4 cards. IF you can't win from this, you aren't going to win in any form of Competitive Magic anyway.",

   "text_parsed": "Let me just demolish all of the arguments for this being unbalanced, &quot;too good&quot;, &quot;not fun&quot;, or any other way of saying that this classic isn't worthy of being reprinted in every core set henceforth.<br /><br />My friend is fond of the &quot;it's not fun&quot; argument.  Well, me having my <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword of the Paruns\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sword of the Paruns\">Sword of the Paruns</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=disenchant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"disenchant\">disenchant</a>ed at a critical combat moment isn't &quot;fun&quot; for me, but it sure is fun for you given that you've been staring at that disenchant for the last 3 turns and have finally goaded me into making it matter.  There is obviously a win-some lose-some element to the game of magic, where, just like chess, losing isn't very fun.  Now, unless your opponent is REALLY wiping the floor with you, you can usually forget about momentary setbacks, or disruptions in tempo, or card disadvantage, and still have fun by putting up a good fight.  <br /><br />So the relevant question is, is counterspell one of those cards that either<br />A.  Wipes the floor with you so hard and fast that it practically wins games by itself (example, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=umezawa's jitte\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"umezawa's jitte\">umezawa's jitte</a><br />B.  Takes away your ability to put up a good fight (example, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=balance\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"balance\">balance</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=isochron scepter\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"isochron scepter\">isochron scepter</a> with practically any card on it)<br /><br />The clear answer is no.  It is, absent of any other shenanigans, 1 for 1 card trade, just like disenchant. <br /><br />Then there are those that argue that this is too &quot;general&quot;.  That that balanced way of doing this is by splitting it up into <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=negate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"negate\">negate</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=essence scatter\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"essence scatter\">essence scatter</a>.  Well, for one, counterspell here is double-blue, drastically reducing it's splash-ability, and hence it's usability in any deck that isn't mono-blue.  More importantly, a &quot;general&quot; counter is already facing the huge drawback that it is just that: a counter.  It requires timing.  You cannot top-deck a counterspell and have it retroactively counter a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=rampaging baloths\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"rampaging baloths\">rampaging baloths</a> that hit the field three turns earlier, in the same way that mono-black can top-deck a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=doom blade\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"doom blade\">doom blade</a> and have it deal with the threat then and there.  <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom blade\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Doom blade\">Doom blade</a> in black only hits creatures, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=disenchant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"disenchant\">disenchant</a> in white only hits artifacts or enchantments, so doesn't that mean counterspell in blue is overpowered for being able to hit ANYTHING?  The answer is, of course not, because that is in fact completely misleading and inaccurate.  Counter-spell can hit <i>spells</i>, but can do nothing about permanents already in play, or activated or triggered abilities of them or cards in your hand.  A card is only ever a spell for a very short period of time, after all.  Blue is the color of effects that are more generally useful against anything, but weaker as a result.  For example, the whole idea of bouncing things, ala <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=boomerang\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"boomerang\">boomerang</a>.  Can hit any type of permanent, but it only buys you one or two turns time before your opponent can replay the offending permanent and hurt us with it again.  Counterspell, in this same manner, aligns with the nature of the color.  Useful against almost everything, but with an implicitly large drawback compared to what other colors can do.  <br /><br />So, what?  Is this really just too cheap for what it does, that we must have to put up with these <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=cancel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"cancel\">cancel</a>s and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=dissipate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"dissipate\">dissipate</a>s?  It's not that they aren't usable, it's that they are just not necessary, not WARRANTED, in comparison to this elegant precedent right here (especially what with all the power-creep we've been seeing lately).  Elegance counts for a lot, Wizards, and they don't come much more elegant than <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=counterspell\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"counterspell\">counterspell</a>.<br /><br />",

Egomaniacal Undertones</u><br /><u>4. Nonsensical Referrals</u><br /><u>5. Conclusion</u><br /><br /><b>1.</b> Lyoncet, I'm sure that at some point in your inane life, you decided to start up a game of Magic: The Gathering. At some point afterwards, be it days, months, or maybe years, you stumbled upon the Gatherer database and decided to give commenting on cards a whirl. Sure, it may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but little did young Lyoncet know that the one comment he created on Counterspell (1) would be, in nearly three years' time, ripped to pieces and ferociously rebuked by a team of Oscar-winning writers. This forthcoming analysis should serve as guidance to all those who mistakenly took Lyoncet's words to heart and make, hopefully, all of us reconsider Lyoncet's sanity.<br /><br /><b>2.</b> In his failed rebuttal of User supershawn's correct posting (2), User Lyoncet makes an atrocious plethora of logical mistakes. First off, he claims that, &quot;Cancel exists because a 2 CMC universal hard counter was deemed too good and is meant played in formats where Counterspell isn't legal.&quot; (1) However, he provides no evidence to support this outrageously incorrect claim, instead he uses his <i>'superiority'</i> to logically outwrestle supershawn's (2). In fact, this sort of psychological intimidation is an indication of deep psychological issues (outlined in section 3).<br /><br /><b>3.</b> Starting from his first sentence, it is made clear that Lyoncet's comment has deeply egotistical undertones. As Dr. Jones of Wisconsin University attributes, &quot;his attempts at enforcing his logical 'superiority' upon his unsuspecting victim can be deemed as nothing else but incipient megalomania.&quot; (3) This is evident by his repeated mentions of his so-believed 'superiority'. As Dr. Jones mentions in the interview (3), his introduction demonstrates his inappropriate views towards God and religion. In fact, by countering the will of God with a 57mm * 82mm piece of cardboard, he views himself as a deity of sorts. Futhermore, he fancies himself as an expert on the field of MTG. However, by proving how incorrect he truly is, we can see that not only is this dangerous to his friends and &quot;fellow blue mages&quot; (2), but &quot;he's a danger to us all&quot; (3). <br /><br /><b>4.</b> Next, let's take a look at some of the cards Lyoncet referred to in his comment. He said that Force of Will and Dissipate would be a more apt substitution than Cancel in a deck &quot;meant <i>(to be)</i> played in formats where Counterspell isn't legal&quot; (1). First of all, Dissipate? Sure, the card's effects may be slightly better in certain circumstances, but how could you even get a Dissipate? It only appears in two expansions! Cancel, being more ubiquitous, appears in <b>ten</b> expansions, making its obtainment around seven times more likely. He also cites Force of Will. That thing isn't even modern-legal! Something's definitely wrong here. Just another sign of burgeoning egomania (section 2, (3)). Lyoncet also lists Arcane Denial, Cryptic Command, Mana Leak, and more as alternatives, and they would all be rebutted flat, if only the character limit wasn't closing in fast.<br /><br /><b>5.</b> In conclusion, on examining the above post by Lyoncet, after carefully working my way through the haze of logical fallacies (section 2), abuse of references (section 4), and potential crimes against humanity (section 3), I have demonstrated that, beneath it all, the work betrays the author's staggering ignorance of the actual workings of MTG. While the author's wildly swerving train of thought did at one point flirt with coherence, this brief encounter was more likely a chance event than a result of even rudimentary lucidity.<br /><br /><b><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=-Swag_Crow\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"-Swag_Crow\">-Swag_Crow</a></b><br /><i>P.S. Don't forget to check out my new hit TV show, <i>Crowin' in the Wind</i>, on CROW Network!</i><br /><i>P.S.S. Sorry this isn't all autocarded. </i><br /><br /><b><u>Citations:</u></b><br /><br />(1): Lyoncet's rebuttal of supershawn's comment (2). Posted at 3/13/2011 4:23:00 PM and too abhorrent to post here.<br /><br />(2): &quot;*** classic, everytime someone plays cancel I laugh at them, I tell them cancel only exists so that you can have moar counterspells in your deck, your not supposed to put them in unless you already have 4 of these. - supershawn&quot;<br /><br />(3): &quot;Interview with Dr. Professor Jones PhD, Wisconsin University:<br />Swag_Crow: Let's cut to the chase. Given User Lyoncet's comment, what would you say about his psychological status?<br />Dr. Jones: Wow. His claims about repressing the will of God truly are shocking. In my career, I have never seen degeneration to such a degree.<br />Swag_Crow: So you believe he has deep egomaniacal issues?<br />Dr. Jones: Yes. It's very troubling.

   "text_posted": "[b][u]@Lyoncet[/u][/b]\n\n[b]Table of Contents:[/b]\n[u]1. Introduction[/u]\n[u]2. Logical Fallacies & Unsupported Claims[/u]\n[u]3. Egomaniacal Undertones[/u]\n[u]4. Nonsensical Referrals[/u]\n[u]5. Conclusion[/u]\n\n[b]1.[/b] Lyoncet, I'm sure that at some point in your inane life, you decided to start up a game of Magic: The Gathering. At some point afterwards, be it days, months, or maybe years, you stumbled upon the Gatherer database and decided to give commenting on cards a whirl. Sure, it may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but little did young Lyoncet know that the one comment he created on Counterspell (1) would be, in nearly three years' time, ripped to pieces and ferociously rebuked by a team of Oscar-winning writers. This forthcoming analysis should serve as guidance to all those who mistakenly took Lyoncet's words to heart and make, hopefully, all of us reconsider Lyoncet's sanity.\n\n[b]2.[/b] In his failed rebuttal of User supershawn's correct posting (2), User Lyoncet makes an atrocious plethora of logical mistakes. First off, he claims that, \"Cancel exists because a 2 CMC universal hard counter was deemed too good and is meant played in formats where Counterspell isn't legal.\" (1) However, he provides no evidence to support this outrageously incorrect claim, instead he uses his [i]'superiority'[/i] to logically outwrestle supershawn's (2). In fact, this sort of psychological intimidation is an indication of deep psychological issues (outlined in section 3).\n\n[b]3.[/b] Starting from his first sentence, it is made clear that Lyoncet's comment has deeply egotistical undertones. As Dr. Jones of Wisconsin University attributes, \"his attempts at enforcing his logical 'superiority' upon his unsuspecting victim can be deemed as nothing else but incipient megalomania.\" (3) This is evident by his repeated mentions of his so-believed 'superiority'. As Dr. Jones mentions in the interview (3), his introduction demonstrates his inappropriate views towards God and religion. In fact, by countering the will of God with a 57mm * 82mm piece of cardboard, he views himself as a deity of sorts. Futhermore, he fancies himself as an expert on the field of MTG. However, by proving how incorrect he truly is, we can see that not only is this dangerous to his friends and \"fellow blue mages\" (2), but \"he's a danger to us all\" (3). \n\n[b]4.[/b] Next, let's take a look at some of the cards Lyoncet referred to in his comment. He said that Force of Will and Dissipate would be a more apt substitution than Cancel in a deck \"meant [i](to be)[/i] played in formats where Counterspell isn't legal\" (1). First of all, Dissipate? Sure, the card's effects may be slightly better in certain circumstances, but how could you even get a Dissipate? It only appears in two expansions! Cancel, being more ubiquitous, appears in [b]ten[/b] expansions, making its obtainment around seven times more likely. He also cites Force of Will. That thing isn't even modern-legal! Something's definitely wrong here. Just another sign of burgeoning egomania (section 2, (3)). Lyoncet also lists Arcane Denial, Cryptic Command, Mana Leak, and more as alternatives, and they would all be rebutted flat, if only the character limit wasn't closing in fast.\n\n[b]5.[/b] In conclusion, on examining the above post by Lyoncet, after carefully working my way through the haze of logical fallacies (section 2), abuse of references (section 4), and potential crimes against humanity (section 3), I have demonstrated that, beneath it all, the work betrays the author's staggering ignorance of the actual workings of MTG. While the author's wildly swerving train of thought did at one point flirt with coherence, this brief encounter was more likely a chance event than a result of even rudimentary lucidity.\n\n[b][autocard]-Swag_Crow[/autocard][/b]\n[i]P.S. Don't forget to check out my new hit TV show, [i]Crowin' in the Wind[/i], on CROW Network![/i]\n[i]P.S.S. Sorry this isn't all autocarded. [/i]\n\n[b][u]Citations:[/u][/b]\n\n(1): Lyoncet's rebuttal of supershawn's comment (2). Posted at 3/13/2011 4:23:00 PM and too abhorrent to post here.\n\n(2): \"*** classic, everytime someone plays cancel I laugh at them, I tell them cancel only exists so that you can have moar counterspells in your deck, your not supposed to put them in unless you already have 4 of these. - supershawn\"\n\n(3): \"Interview with Dr. Professor Jones PhD, Wisconsin University:\nSwag_Crow: Let's cut to the chase. Given User Lyoncet's comment, what would you say about his psychological status?\nDr. Jones: Wow. His claims about repressing the will of God truly are shocking. In my career, I have never seen degeneration to such a degree.\nSwag_Crow: So you believe he has deep egomaniacal issues?\nDr. Jones: Yes. It's very troubling. In fact, his attempts at enforcing his logical 'superiority' upon an unsuspecting victim can be seen as nothing but incipient megalomania. Watch out for that guy - he's a danger to us all.\"\n",

Cards like Tsunami were there to keep things from getting out of hand... and they are a teaching tool as well.\n\nYou see, cards which are designed to punish a specific strategy teach you a valuable lesson: putting all of your eggs in one basket leaves you highly vulnerable to particular events that may happen. This is an important piece of wisdom that applies to our lives way beyond a card game.",

   "text_posted": "Whoa...... I thought it was unglued. This card is terrible.\n\nA selection of 6/6s for 6 ordered from lowest to highest community rating:\n\nThis: \"Oh god those numbers are so high let's make it suck.\" Horribly unfun to play.\n\n[autocard]Frenetic Raptor[/autocard]: Terrible at first glance, but has a place as a weird anti-beast sideboard card. Which makes me laugh if nothing else.\n\n[autocard]Arctic Nishoba[/autocard]: Quite good while it's on the field, drawback isn't prohibitive and when it dies you don't feel like you got gypped.\n\n[autocard]Hellcarver Demon[/autocard]: The lowest rated mythic rare on the list (still >4.0), since it's so risky and can be stopped by any flyer. I don't really like the feel: \"Find a broken combo or else Flip a coin: Heads you win, tails you lose.\"\n\n[autocard]Intet, the Dreamer[/autocard]: Rated #6 of 10 in the Invasion/Planar Chaos cycle of awesome dragons with game-changing abilities. Makes you want to play a triple-color deck that can pull off summoning them and throwing mana at them, and feels epic when it works. The cycle gets crazy powerful, but at least you have to build around them and there's plenty of ways to fight them.\n\n\n....above here is where I think it gets stupid. The mythic rare Titan cycle and Lorwyn incarnation cycle are monocolor cards that give insane abilities attached to great creatures. You barely have to think, because most usual decks that can pay their mana cost will simply want them. U/B got to the top 2 spots in 2010 worlds with \"control, control, control, [autocard]Grave Titan[/autocard]\". Faerie decks run an army of cheap faeries... plus [autocard]Wurmcoil Engine[/autocard], because, hell, why wouldn't they want to play that for 6 colorless? [autocard]Rampaging Baloths[/autocard] is ludicrously broken in a landfall deck... but pick up a green deck and throw him in instead of a different biggie and you'll probably do fantastically.\n\nIt's just so... thoughtless. Big creatures with awesome straightforward effects are fine... but they shouldn't be so overpowered that a control deck can literally just throw them in to win.",

Because it effects the lands, creatures and your hand, it seems hard to get a leg up on  your opponent. If it only affected creatures and land, i would get it. But since its hand also, seems like you will lose cards also, even if you are trying to hold back on playing them.  Only way I could think of it, is if you are playing white/red, play 2 lands and then play like 4 lightning bolts (or other burn) in a row, and then play Balance. In that case, your opp's lands, creatures and hand is wrecked. Balance is only good if you play cards that end up in your graveyard (instants and sorceries), isn't that right?

   "text_parsed": "You guys wouldn't believe this now, but this card was unrestricted for years. Sol Ring was limited to 1-per-deck almost since the beginning, but it took until 1999, if I remember right, until they finally restricted Mana Vault. Notice it was printed all the way through 5th edition...!<br /><br />Although I often ran 4 Dark Rituals in many decks, I never put in more than 1 Mana Vault because it seemed just plain cruel to do so. The first time I used a Mana Vault, it was in a mono-red deck; I summoned a Shivan Dragon with it on the 3rd turn and just sat there, staring at my cards on the table in disbelief. I couldn't believe a card this powerful was being allowed FOUR PER DECK. Compared to Dark Ritual, Mana Vault provides the same amount of mana, without the color commitment, is reusable, and can even be cast on one turn and have all 3 mana used another turn.

   "text_posted": "You guys wouldn't believe this now, but this card was unrestricted for years. Sol Ring was limited to 1-per-deck almost since the beginning, but it took until 1999, if I remember right, until they finally restricted Mana Vault. Notice it was printed all the way through 5th edition...!\n\nAlthough I often ran 4 Dark Rituals in many decks, I never put in more than 1 Mana Vault because it seemed just plain cruel to do so. The first time I used a Mana Vault, it was in a mono-red deck; I summoned a Shivan Dragon with it on the 3rd turn and just sat there, staring at my cards on the table in disbelief. I couldn't believe a card this powerful was being allowed FOUR PER DECK. Compared to Dark Ritual, Mana Vault provides the same amount of mana, without the color commitment, is reusable, and can even be cast on one turn and have all 3 mana used another turn.

Well, it was a particularly busy night at the shop, and I had a couple decks with me, including this one. I went with my Wife who was playing a deck She had made, and then my Cousin was there with a few of his decks, and after an hour or so, one of the REALLY big tables they had in there cleared up. \r<br />\r<br />The Table was HUGE and mostly, it was used by the guys who play those games with the little figurines and stuff (I don't know which game, or how they play so I can't give details) but they need a pretty big table to play it, and, after an hour or so, they all left, so, a bunch of people asked around about playing a big Multi Player Game.\r<br />\r<br />I was for sure in on it, because I LOVE Multi Player games. Well, a lot of people decided to play, so there ended up being 10 of us total, and so it was a HUGE game. After about 4 turns, I'd managed to power out not only some Enchantresses, but also Ali, which was quickly Lightning Bolted, and then, I started playing out some quick Mana stuff to play my hand. \r<br />\r<br />I got one or two Underworld Dreams on the table, and as I was playing them, two people hadn't really seen them before, and so I explained what they did, and then, proceeded to cast Wheel of Fortune, which I then Forked and Twincasted for the win. \r<br />\r<br />I beat 9 other players by using Fork and Twincast on Wheel of Fortune for a total of 21 points of damage to EVERY person I was playing against. 9 people took 21 points of damage because of Underworld heh.

However, I though Howl from beyond had enough going for it to replace Hand of Death.<br /><br />First of all, Hand of Death isn't that exciting.  If it isn't online, a few people will miss it, but not many.  Secondly, Master's Edition IV was low on combat tricks.  Those are typically instants that change the result of combat.  I think they are very important to limited play.  Howl from Beyond is a pretty weak combat trick, but that can be OK.  Finally, the set needed cards that a Tron drafter could pick up quite late.  These cards need to be so weak that they often woudn't make a deck's top 23 spells, but work well with the Tron.<br /><br />The Tron drafter is going to spend some mid pack picks picking up Tron elements.  There need to be some playable spells still in the packs for the later picks to make up for this.<br /><br />Another way of looking at this is that a typical drafter plays 23 spells, and maybe one non-basic land.  That's 24 drafted cards, which means that in essence the drafter is playing picks 1-8 from all three packs.  Of course some of those don't work out, and a few later picks are used.  Meanwhile, the Tron drafter plays maybe 9 extra non-basic lands.  Roughly speaking, that brings it up to 33 cards, which means playing picks 1-11 from each pack, and if a few of those don't make it, some even later picks!<br /><br />The problem is that while Ebony Rhino isn't amazing, it probably isn't going to be left in the pack 11th pick either.  I thought the set needed some cards weaker than that to fill out the Tron deck.  Howl from Beyond is a try at that   If you actually have the tron, this is 7 or more extra damage, which can quickly end a game.  It isn't an amazing card, but I think it helps fill out the spell slots in an exciting way.<br />",

These cards need to be so weak that they often woudn't make a deck's top 23 spells, but work well with the Tron.\n\nThe Tron drafter is going to spend some mid pack picks picking up Tron elements.  There need to be some playable spells still in the packs for the later picks to make up for this.\n\nAnother way of looking at this is that a typical drafter plays 23 spells, and maybe one non-basic land.  That's 24 drafted cards, which means that in essence the drafter is playing picks 1-8 from all three packs.  Of course some of those don't work out, and a few later picks are used.  Meanwhile, the Tron drafter plays maybe 9 extra non-basic lands.  Roughly speaking, that brings it up to 33 cards, which means playing picks 1-11 from each pack, and if a few of those don't make it, some even later picks!\n\nThe problem is that while Ebony Rhino isn't amazing, it probably isn't going to be left in the pack 11th pick either.  I thought the set needed some cards weaker than that to fill out the Tron deck.  Howl from Beyond is a try at that   If you actually have the tron, this is 7 or more extra damage, which can quickly end a game.  It isn't an amazing card, but I think it helps fill out the spell slots in an exciting way.\n",

Not the way I read it. It feels more like...like a Zord.<br /><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel Hellkite\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Steel Hellkite\">Steel Hellkite</a>? That's a dragon. It was actually born a dragon, made of metal, because that's how things work on Mirrodin. Mechanical doesn't mean non-living.

   "text_posted": "Yeah, no, Dark Ritual is NOT in flavor. I wholeheartedly agree with Max_Glycine, and you suicide black players shouldn't vote his honest tidbit of truth down so low.\n\nFor M13, they need a black boon for a single (B) that says \"Choose one- target player loses 3 life or target creature gets -0/-3 until end of turn\" and they need a red boon for a single (R) that says \"Add (R)(R)(R) to your mana pool\". Of course, if they think that red ritual is too powerful, they should continue printing [autocard]Pyretic Ritual[/autocard].\n\nEDIT: To whomever voted my comment at .5 stars, to hell with your opinion. Look up [autocard]Infernal Plunge[/autocard] from the Innistrad spoilers. I will NOT be surprised if they start doing that black bolt that I described.",

Sometimes just simply resetting the game is a good play, but the real trick is to build so that you have finishing creatures that will survive the destruction, while your opponent may not.  There are five categories of creatures that have this added survivability factor:\r<br />\r<br />1) Suspended and Phased \r<br />2) Indestructible \r<br />3) Creatures that naturally recur, e.g. Persist and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tuktuk the Explorer\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Tuktuk the Explorer\">Tuktuk the Explorer</a>\r<br />4) Creature generating permanents of a type that isn't destroyed\r<br />5) Regenerating creatures\r<br />\r<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree of Annihilation\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Decree of Annihilation\">Decree of Annihilation</a> is the most absolute of the list, but it's difficult to build around because it only leaves category 1 intact, and the 3 or 4 cards of category 4 that are enchantments and planeswalkers.  <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Obliterate\">Obliterate</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jokulhaups\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jokulhaups\">Jokulhaups</a> are a bit easier because they allow category 2 and 3 to survive.  However, this card is the only one that allows category 5, regenerators, a chance to live. along with creature producing artifacts.  Those are only two categories, but together they comprise about 90% of the cards of this type.  Consequently, Devastation fits seamlessly into far more decks than does Jokulhaups.\r<br />\r<br />In short, Decree and Jokulhaups are great in a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira of the Ghitu\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jhoira of the Ghitu\">Jhoira of the Ghitu</a> EDH deck, but Devastation remains good even in decks where all you have to survive are things like<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name= Spiritmonger\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\" Spiritmonger\"> Spiritmonger</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mortivore\">Mortivore</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning Station\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Summoning Station\">Summoning Station</a>.

There are five categories of creatures that have this added survivability factor:\r\n\r\n1) Suspended and Phased \r\n2) Indestructible \r\n3) Creatures that naturally recur, e.g. Persist and [autocard]Tuktuk the Explorer[/autocard]\r\n4) Creature generating permanents of a type that isn't destroyed\r\n5) Regenerating creatures\r\n\r\n[autocard]Decree of Annihilation[/autocard] is the most absolute of the list, but it's difficult to build around because it only leaves category 1 intact, and the 3 or 4 cards of category 4 that are enchantments and planeswalkers.  [autocard]Obliterate[/autocard] and [autocard]Jokulhaups[/autocard] are a bit easier because they allow category 2 and 3 to survive.  However, this card is the only one that allows category 5, regenerators, a chance to live. along with creature producing artifacts.  Those are only two categories, but together they comprise about 90% of the cards of this type.  Consequently, Devastation fits seamlessly into far more decks than does Jokulhaups.\r\n\r\nIn short, Decree and Jokulhaups are great in a [autocard]Jhoira of the Ghitu[/autocard] EDH deck, but Devastation remains good even in decks where all you have to survive are things like[autocard] Spiritmonger[/autocard], [autocard]Mortivore[/autocard] and [autocard]Summoning Station[/autocard].
