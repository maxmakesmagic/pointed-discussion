On that turn, he noticed that I had a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Damnation\">Damnation</a> in my hand, so unless he had a way to kill Sharuum and get an extra <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /> mana to bring her back each turn, I'd at least survive a few more turns. <br /><br />It all turned grim when I realized that I played <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No Mercy\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"No Mercy\">No Mercy</a> a few turns ago. <br /><br />So here's what happened: Sharuum attacks, dealing damage, then getting killed by No Mercy. He'd then Proliferate with Contagion Engine, giving Everflowing Chalice an additional 2 counters (or +<img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /> mana gained from it).
