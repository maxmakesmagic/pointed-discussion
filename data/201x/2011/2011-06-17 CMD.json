Against tutors this card is fine, but it's too expensive to be an effective counter to extra turns in EDH.",

And on the very back of this card itself, exchange control cards are greatly improved, which tends to be just as frustrating.\r<br />\r<br />Third, from my seat, it's not as if every other deck was running <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blatant Thievery\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Blatant Thievery\">Blatant Thievery</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Treachery\">Treachery</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Bribery\">Bribery</a>.

Though that might not dry Timmy's tears when he's on the end of a Bribery, it means that self-interested Spikes will correct the problem themselves by instead playing <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jokulhaups\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jokulhaups\">Jokulhaups</a> <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Obliterate\">Obliterate</a> decks and the like, which always were better than counter/steal in multiplayer anyway, and much more frustrating.

It's not like those decks were just wiping out the competition, and having both decks out at the same time when one just makes a joke of the other is just as bad PR.  In fact, most people are upset about this card, if you read the comments.\r<br />\r<br />Which brings me to my fifth point.  This card's effect is way too cheap.

But every narrowly tailored answer card before has at least taken a non-land slot in the deck, and was also much more answerable by virtue of being non-land.  And if you're going to make a land with a strong effect, why not at least make the activation cost something?  Just tap one land and - boom! - every <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind Control\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mind Control\">Mind Control</a> is countered and the ones that haven't been played yet are more worthless than <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm Crow\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Storm Crow\">Storm Crow</a>?

Just wreck everyone else's Sol Ring or Lightning Greaves. \r\n\r\nI think I'll be making a deck around this guy. I already have the vast majority of cards for this type of deck. I would just need to temporarily reallocate them.",

There are some very powerful things that can be done with this card:<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mulldrifter\">Mulldrifter</a>. Paying for the evoke cost then duplicating will leave you with a 2/2 flyer that drew you four cards. FOUR CARDS. For five mana. Thats <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidings\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Tidings\">Tidings</a> with a free 2/2 creature. Or you could just play it for seven mana to get two creatures.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue Kavu\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Flametongue Kavu\">Flametongue Kavu</a>. Now this is crazy. You're paying six mana for two 4/2 creatures and two free <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fireblast\">Fireblast</a>s. That kills just about anything else that costs six mana and some things that cost more. That is a lot of card advantage.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket Mage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Trinket Mage\">Trinket Mage</a>. Now this interaction is amazing in the commander format. Think about a curve like this:<br />Begin turn five with four lands in play, then play a land and cast Riku. On your next turn, you can play a land then cast and copy a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket Mage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Trinket Mage\">Trinket Mage</a> to get a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol Ring\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sol Ring\">Sol Ring</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei's Divining Top\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sensei's Divining Top\">Sensei's Divining Top</a>. Then use your extra land to play the Sol Ring and use the Sol Ring to play and use the Top. That's a lot of consistency from two cards in a singleton format. Especially considering you have access to one of the cards all game. Oh yea, you also get two 2/2s.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal Witness\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Eternal Witness\">Eternal Witness</a>. Having the ability to get back your two best cads from the graveyard can be extremely good. And with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riku\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Riku\">Riku</a> out, that is like getting four spells because you will probably be able to duplicate both of them.<br /><br />I could go on and on about all of the amazing creature to duplicate, but you can also duplicate instants and sorceries. I will mainly focus on large amazing spells, but keep in mind that you can duplicate any spell you want.<br />-Any spell that allows you to take an extra turn (or turns in the case of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time Stretch\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Time Stretch\">Time Stretch</a>). Taking even more turns is always good, but because you have an extra turn, you might be able to give another player an extra turn for political reasons. This might not be the best use of resources, but it can save you from losing or gain you anther ally. It could also make the player less likely to counter your extra turn.<br />-Any card with suspend (even creatures) will benefit from this because you didn't pay mana for them that turn. I'll use <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan Meteor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Shivan Meteor\">Shivan Meteor</a> as an example of a card to copy, but it's not the most spectacular (the most would be <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse of the Cabal\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Curse of the Cabal\">Curse of the Cabal</a> but that is in another color and hard to resolve). Getting two meteors will kill anything so dead it should be exiled from the exiled zone.<br />There are too many other cards to explain them all in depth, so I'll include a list of cards that would be amazing to copy:<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biomantic Mastery\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Biomantic Mastery\">Biomantic Mastery</a>. You should be drawing a lot of cards.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blatant Thievery\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Blatant Thievery\">Blatant Thievery</a>. Getting control of two permanents from every player? Sweet.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective Unconscious\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Collective Unconscious\">Collective Unconscious</a>. More card draw. This effect is also helped by Riku making more creatures.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflux\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Conflux\">Conflux</a>. Not completely in color, but being able to tutor for TEN CARDS seemed to good to leave off.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush of Wurms\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Crush of Wurms\">Crush of Wurms</a>. Six 6/6s much? Plus you get more when you flash it back.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death by Dragons\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Death by Dragons\">Death by Dragons</a>. So everyone other that target player gets two 5/5 flyers? I'm fine casting that.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Denying Wind\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Denying Wind\">Denying Wind</a>. Your opponent shouldn't have many threats left in their deck after this.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring Insight\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Recurring Insight\">Recurring Insight</a>. Along with other along with any other rebound spell. Casting it four times seems nice.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth and Nail\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Tooth and Nail\">Tooth and Nail</a>. Being able to search for four creatures to put straight into play? Not a bad deal.<br />-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warp World\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Warp World\">Warp World</a>. This one should be used with enter the battlefield token making effects.

A simple damage or removal to Kaalia leaves her right back in the commander zone with the need for 2 more colorless to cast out again.  Hit her twice and she almost becomes prohibitive to get out and in the meanwhile my hand was filling up with huge currently uncastable demons,dragons and angels!  In the meanwhile, I was not fetching any smaller blockers and was left wide open and gutted.  I was in fact getting a bit mana hosed for about 4 turns which probably did me in overall but I feel like this deck relies too heavily on Kaalia and once shes down n out, the deck falters hard.  Which makes me question building edh decks around the commander's abilities. Commanders are easily wiped.  Whispersilk Cloak?  Sure with a 1 in 99 chance of coming out.  Not the answer.

For one thing, while he CAN sac himself to his own ability, what real gain do you get out of it? You get to avoid certain exile spells, yay? If you use him as the general, sac'ing himself does you NO good since he'd go straight to the command zone again, even if you did want to avoid a Path or a Journey or O-ring. If you try to combo him with dead Mikaeus, the opponent is going to realize it very quickly and then just get rid of Mikaeus. Heck, his first ability is disadvantageous if the opponent has a kill spell ready for him of some sort since if you try to go for the kill with him, they're just going to nuke him when he swings. Not only that, but you have to get rid of ALL of his +1/+1 counters to give one creature that much in terms of -x/-x, meaning if they can come back from his swing, you're down quite a few creatures while they can chump and swing through Vish Kal and widdle you down until they get rid of him. Now, can he be a good card? Yes, but you also have to make sure your field is ready for him to go to town, one false step and you're screwed. Heck, even in my combo that I listed, it can be disrupted fairly easily if Karador gets taken out, or if I'm seriously lacking in revival spells.",

Tell your friends that it probably shouldn't be used if you don't think it's fun.\n\nI don't think it's very fun, but it has to exist--generals are very powerful, and there does need to be a way to kill them a little more permanently, albeit they can still be recurred from the library (and shuffling the library makes you able to draw it as well.)\n\nI don't like the idea that moving it from the library to the command zone should be an option. I think these cards are helping to keep the format healthy--players need to learn to not have to be reliant on their generals.\n\nI just sigh and put my general at the bottom, then win since they spent 3 mana on a counterspell and can't counter my bomb.

Just combining any two colors already gives you quite a lot of flexibility and meets needs- three closes all the gaps and still doesn't stretch your mana base too far.  \n\nIf you only needed one color to do whatever you damn well pleased, then that color would instantly get as much hate as old blue. Still, on one card, and an Aura to boot, within a cycle, and it doesn't actually grave them..this is just within the boundary of ok for Green. Do not expect this sort of love in the future, basically ever.",

It is too easy to combo this card. It can be protected with, eg, [autocard]Greater Auramancy[/autocard] or [autocard]Indestructibility[/autocard]. Multiplayer dynamics mean some other players will benefit from it being in play for a while and will leave it alone or even protect it for you. \n\nWorst case, you should be able to get at least one trigger from it or you're almost certainly at fault. For one trigger, it is a bit expensive, but beyond that, it becomes great and can quickly lock down many games.",

But if I was playing Kaalia of the Vast, I would take any Signet over Sol Ring in the opening 7.

I rated it lower because I don't like color pie bleeds, I think it's poor design to allow two colors to do things equally well, except sparingly. However, I can't recall why I felt this was Blue. I support draw in all colors, but I think only Blue should get it straight up.

It doesn't care about the climate, it cares about bananas, because bananas will kill it's opponent, and empower Black. (Bananas work pretty poorly as an example here, I know.) Black only wants that which will help it directly, so it gets little draw.

Combine that with white and blue's various ways of getting creature's through (via unblockability or protection from their creatures), as well as the equipment that gives trample, and Numot's able to get two hits in with relative ease.

The other dragons have an effect that are better in my opinion; Oros can hit their field, so if he gets taken out, he's hit them for far worse. Teneb can bring back whatever's dead, which can seriously help you, and Intet, if you get the top of your deck just right, can let you get whatever spell you want for free, which could turn the tide (I'd say he's weaker than Oros or Teneb, but I'd still rather be able to play my top card for free), and Vorosh can end the game in less hits &amp; works with Graft creatures easily. Ok, so hitting two land isn't bad, but compared to some of the damage the others can do? Especially when Oros shares the same 'double strike giving colors' as Numot and Intent and Vorosh share the 'unblockable' blue cards (as well as being able to trample thanks to green)? I think among the five dragons in the pre-cons, Numot is not the best.",

The other dragons have an effect that are better in my opinion; Oros can hit their field, so if he gets taken out, he's hit them for far worse. Teneb can bring back whatever's dead, which can seriously help you, and Intet, if you get the top of your deck just right, can let you get whatever spell you want for free, which could turn the tide (I'd say he's weaker than Oros or Teneb, but I'd still rather be able to play my top card for free), and Vorosh can end the game in less hits & works with Graft creatures easily. Ok, so hitting two land isn't bad, but compared to some of the damage the others can do? Especially when Oros shares the same 'double strike giving colors' as Numot and Intent and Vorosh share the 'unblockable' blue cards (as well as being able to trample thanks to green)? I think among the five dragons in the pre-cons, Numot is not the best.",

This includes declaring which creatures will block, and how they will block(read the \"Card Text\" on the description page, and not the text printed on the card image; they've clarified it).",

Search 'Community Rating > 4', Green, Rules Text= Draw Cards.\n\nMagus of the Library and Sylvan Library are arguably stronger, but Magus is really just a Library of Alexandria shout-out, so I don't count it, and Sylvan Library is not a creature, so I like Y. Elder for fitting Green's flavor better: We've recently seen a ton of 'just good stuff' creatures with extra abilities, and I think it's going a bit too far, but Green should always have Creatures that can do the work of Spells.\n\nAs for the other cards, the Dredge Mechanic turned out to be too strong, so those cards don't count the same way Magus of the Library doesn't count: 'needs Development'. (Magus also isn't all that Green-flavored)\n\nIf you take into account, in ADDITION to Tournament Worthiness-- Mechanics are Flavorful, Friendly for Fun, and Overall Balance, then this card sits somewhere either a little better than or a little worse than Solemn Simulacrum, and neither Artifacts nor Green should ever get a card that makes either of these two appear to be pale by comparison. That is an excellent standard to look for 'power creep'. It just doesn't get better than Yavimaya Elder. Or shouldn't.",

And I don't have a drawback, like those newfangled new Moxen.\n\n[b]Miss Mox[/b]: Yes, well, colored mana is very important, and you only tap for {2} the turn after you're cast. I'm afraid the Moxen have [i]very, very[/i] high standards. The best I can do is offer you status in the [b]Slightly Less Powerful Than the Moxen Club[/b]. Slightly less prestigious, sure, but it still sets you above almost every  other card ever printed. \n\n[b]Sol Ring:[/b] Oh, well when you put it like that... I'll take it!",

If can find one old card--just one--that uses \"dies,\" \"kills,\" or \"killed\" to refer to a creature going to the graveyard from battle or sending a creature to the graveyard from battle, you will have earned my lifelong respect.\n3) Death is known as being a permanent state, whereas being \"in a graveyard\" is something that changes rapidly (It's my job to change it! Here I Rule). As the hag from [i]Prince Caspian[/i] said, \"Have you ever heard of a witch who truly [i]died[/i]? There's always some way to bring them back....\"\n4) Creatures are \"summoned,\" and then they have \"summoning sickness.\" Then, eventually, they are \"sacrificed\" or \"destroyed.\" After that, they are either \"regenerated\" or \"put into the graveyard.\" None of these terms--I repeat, none--are used to refer to the basic human life cycle. When you start to use anthropomorphic terms, you start to bond with those creatures. However, you are a planeswalker. You don't bond with them. You use them in whatever way you see fit.\n5) The way this card is printed has been commonly accepted MTG vernacular for many years. (Starts fake \"crotchety old man\" voice) You punk whippersnappers coming in with yer fancy new words, tryin' to change the way we done it since before yer gran'pappy was in diapers, why, I just got one thing to say to that: \"YOU ROTTEN KIDS GET OFF MY LAWN!\"(Stops fake \"crotchety old man\" voice)\n\n@lorendorky The problem, really, is that vampires are black's way of trying to imitate blue. Instead of trying to imitate other colors, they should be trying to create some more originals. Like zombies. However, I, being predisposed to blue anyway, do tend to enjoy a vampire or two every now and then.",

Opponents gain life (which you can make them as said in a previous comment) and you get it back. This was run in the zoo pre ban. Now, i am betting that it was run more for the creature control than for the actual damage. 3 mana for 1 damage isnt all that spectacular.

I like to think he learned something.\"\n\nIf you expect to go onto Duels of the Planeswalkers and find any players with an ounce of skill, you will be looking for a very long time. That is similar to looking for a needle in a heystack. You can find it, but not often enough for it to matter. \n\nOnto the card. I can see its card advantage potential. Opponents gain life (which you can make them as said in a previous comment) and you get it back. This was run in the zoo pre ban. Now, i am betting that it was run more for the creature control than for the actual damage. 3 mana for 1 damage isnt all that spectacular. All this card says is that you will always be able to have it in your hand, something red mages crave. Why else would grim lavamancer be used in every red deck wins up to this day? ",
