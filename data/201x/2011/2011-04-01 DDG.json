Dragons are large, majestic creatures, and their mana costs reflect that.\n2) They wanted it to be a card you wanted to draw, making it rare to get inside the deck. A casual new player who draws that card will love it all the more when it's one of a kind.\n3) If a casual player wanted more, then they'll have to go out and buy another duel deck package. Excellent scheme on the part of Wizards. Well played.\n\nI already plan to buy at least five Knights versus Dragons, four for myself to Build powerful casual theme decks around, and one for my kids. I'm sure my daughter will want the dragons. She makes me so proud. :D",

Temporary Insanity, Mark of Mutiny, and Act of Treason all emphasize the creature switching allegiances. In particular, they open the possibility that the creature is doing so of their own free will, albeit not thinking clearly at the time (hence the temporariness).

This helps it to be recognized by players familiar with the Blue card, and connecting it to that card by mirroring the mana cost helps to communicate the whole concept better. If, for example, there were ever going to be a card like '1W: Destroy target black attacking creature' or something like that, then costing 1W, the same as Doom Blade except in color, is important so that you can quickly make the jump to 'this is White Doom Blade'.\r<br />\r<br />Those kinds of 'tells' may not be as important for experienced players as new ones, but since the game needs new players, it needs to invest some thought and attention to the new players as well as the old hats.\r<br />\r<br />All I'm saying is, from a design standpoint, this card seems to be a perfect execution, even if the modern Act of Treason is 'strictly better'.",
