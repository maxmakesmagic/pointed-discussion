You can flash this back by turn 5 using just '1 basic per turn' mana, a full turn earlier than a '4UU: draw 4' would do.  AND drawing 2 cards twice is probably better than drawing 4 all at once.

Note that it would have to add at least its starting power in permanent buff to be worth using the ability and not simply attacking. A likely creature? I think not.<br /><br />Note that I'm assuming that this cost involved tapping in the above. While not technically a requirement I'd be surprised if you could find a competitive ability that didn't require it. The only other costs you could likely pay are life (the absolutely tiny selection of competitive life-for-damage cards are all well known and not sufficient) or cards (you can only discard 5 if you're going to hit every land drop, as required.

If my math is right, it's about a 1 in 80 chance to blank on this assuming you've drawn 10 cards by the time you play this. I would only recommend playing this in a deck where it is your only non-creature spell, because even adding a few spells from my sideboard can make the odds on this much worse. For example, adding 6 non-creature spells from my sideboard increases the odds of blanking on this to about 1 in 26. Still pretty good odds, but if that's what your deck looks like before sideboarding, it will probably only get worse post board. 5/5 and an easy 4-of in my creature-heavy deck.",

So, whether you could declare Briarhorn as a blocker during the block step doesn't matter, since it's sacrificed before it can actually reach the damage step where it will block the creature. So, no you can't evoke a blocker, but whether you can evoke a block declaration I'm unsure of. But I am doubtful of it.<br /><br />Secondly, pandemonium checks power upon the ability's resolution. Meaning you put the Pandemonium effect on the stack first, followed by the +3/+3. Thus, it resolves the +3/+3 boost first for a total of 6/6 when Pandemonium resolves.",

Also, the color requirement is quite stiff so that should reduce the cost by 1, but this is in Alara block so that is negated enough to make it irrelevant. That adds up to a total of 5cmc. So it's overcoatsted by one if it was a creature.

However being an enchantment actually has some advantages of its own that need to be factored in. It can be placed on a creature that has double strike, an ability not uncommon for red, it can interact with various enchantment based card effects like auramancer (not that that would be synergistic), it can be placed on some kind of unblockable creature like dread warlock or invisible stalker (+1 cmc bringing total to -1cmc)<br /><br />So in summary this card would be pretty competitive at a cost of 4cmc.

It's multicolorness (sorta) and kicker templating really allowed them to make a much, much more interesting take on Terror/Doom Blade.
