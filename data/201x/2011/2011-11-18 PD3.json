An \"enchant creature\" spell needs a creature target in order to be cast, which is why this new version starts with \"enchant creature card in a graveyard\" - it targets a creature in the graveyard. For the same reason, the original version used \"enchant dead creature\" because it looked for a target in the graveyard; the problem with that being that once the creature leaves the graveyard its no longer dead.",
