   "text_parsed": "Great to finally see a G/W planeswalker! And Ajani, no less!<br /><br />This Ajani is clearly not an aggro card; I think that green devotion wants to be playing a threat here, and white weenies wants to curve out at 4 mana absolute tops. That doesn't make him bad, just situational. I think the biggest loss here is Naya Hexproof - the abilitiy to grab the perfect equipment or creature seems nice, but the mana cost is just too high. <br /><br />With his abilities, he probably wants to be played in a midrange-y or control deck that has at least some creatures and a bunch of planeswalkers, and is resilient enough to ensure that Ajani won't be unprotected when it hits the board. With that in mind, I think the two best decks for this guy are the Bant Walkers deck we saw make a splash in February, or Reid Duke's recent Junk Midrange list.<br /><br />In Bant Walkers, Ajani serves the purpose of digging for threats like Kiora or Elspeth while also buying time (he's got to be killed eventually or the 100 life will be a serious pain). A problem is that some of these lists ran few to no creatures, making his counter ability irrelevant - I'd predict that the lists we see incorporate a couple more creatures so as to synergize better with Ajani. This doesn't seem hard thought, as Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kruphix play perfectly with what the deck wants to do, at the cost of being forced to tap out a bit more than we might want in the early game. The normal gameplan isn't to swing with these creatures, but extra +1/+1 counters can allow Caryatid to trade with aggro or block bigger threats like Polukranos, and allow Courser to grow to a serious beater quite quickly. This is a deck I'm definitely interested in playing with, so I can't wait to see what Ajani does here.<br /><br />Ajani might be even better in a deck like Reid Duke's Junk Midrange list. The ability to dig for finishers like Obzedat, Archangel of Thune, and Elspeth is absolutely fantastic in this deck, and the +1/+1 ability is exactly what we want on fatties like Polukranos, Reaper of the Wilds, or an Advent of the Wurm token. Since both of his modes help the goals of this deck, I think he'll fit in perfectly here. What's more is that the heavy removal suite and resilience of the creature base makes it quite likely that Ajani will stick around for more than just one turn. Consider that just 3 turns of Ajani could mean that you get to pick your favorite 3 cards out of the top 15 of your deck, or could turn a Polukranos from a 5/5 into a 14/14. It's unfortunate that Obzedat's exile messes with the counters, but the card still seems great in this list.<br /><br />In a vacuum, Ajani is I think a very well-balanced walker. Obviously what holds him back is the 3GW casting cost, which is near the tops of the playable range, but this is no Karametra. The fact that Ajani is always at 6 loyalty T1 and the threat of an 100 life gain looms by turn 4 after playing it means that it soaks up punishment pretty well, which is an extra bonus. I think that the 5 CMC means it won't be a 4-of anywhere, but a definitely good walker that will fit in as a 1- or 2-of in some good decks. And post-rotation, who knows? It could get even better!",

Consider that just 3 turns of Ajani could mean that you get to pick your favorite 3 cards out of the top 15 of your deck, or could turn a Polukranos from a 5/5 into a 14/14. It's unfortunate that Obzedat's exile messes with the counters, but the card still seems great in this list.\n\nIn a vacuum, Ajani is I think a very well-balanced walker. Obviously what holds him back is the 3GW casting cost, which is near the tops of the playable range, but this is no Karametra. The fact that Ajani is always at 6 loyalty T1 and the threat of an 100 life gain looms by turn 4 after playing it means that it soaks up punishment pretty well, which is an extra bonus. I think that the 5 CMC means it won't be a 4-of anywhere, but a definitely good walker that will fit in as a 1- or 2-of in some good decks. And post-rotation, who knows? It could get even better!",

Look at how PWs like Sarkhan Vol and Gideon champion of justice are awful because they don't have abilities that protect themselves. Look at how PWs like Elspeth and Jace 2.0 and Liliana of the Veil are good becuase they have abilities that do (there are of course a few exceptions. Koth is an exception because he was very strong in RDW particularly because he could threaten his ultimate 2 turns after he was dropped.

Because his first +1 only makes your existing creatures bigger (as opposed to spewing out chump blockers or being a kill spell) you'll need to make sure not to get blown out by a removal spell. The more creatures both players have out, the safer Ajani is (the exception being if nobody has any creatures out), since you can put the +1/+1 counters on your smaller critters first to make sure that even if one of your blockers dies, you will have enough creatures left to rumble with anything that tries to attack Ajani.

The other kills the opponent's polukranos and kills ajani with his own polukranos. <br />Versus, both players have Polukranos and Brimaz out. One plays ajani and puts 2 counters on brimaz and 1 on Polukranos. The opponent kills the Brimaz, but he can't profitably swing in to Ajani with his Polukranos + Brimaz without additional help.)<br /><br />Getting 5 loyalty at 5 mana after a +1 is not amazing but it's okay. It's important that after a +1, it can tank a stormbreath dragon attack, which is one of the biggest haste threats in standard right now.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure how good ajani will be. He can protect himself, but the turn you drop him is sketchier than with the other top walkers because there's more chances you get blown out. 5 mana is also above the sweet spot for walkers, although new elspeth is doing perfectly fine and she's 6, so maybe Ajani will be fine. My guess is that after journey prices stabilize, he'll hover around $15-20. New garruk is around $10-15 and I think this ajani is better despite committing you to 2 colors.",

The deck would obviously require mana confluence to guarantee the colors, but with the Charioteers as a four of, there would be a very powerful life linker hitting the field every turn three with boost turn four - in aggro match ups the trouble is storm breath, but if Polukranos is a four of, it would be no problem to plow through, so it is a safe bet there. It doesn't fair so nicely against control, relying heavily on large cmc threats, but seeing Supreme Verdict go away, control decks will have to diminish, being unable to support Elspeth so easily.<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not the deck is a chance, I'm very excited to see Ravnica  rotate out and make room for many three color shenanigans with mana confluence and scry lands.",

Being stuck with lands that can't pay for the cards in your hand is one of the worst things in the game. This land is insurance that you will always have the mana you need to get rolling, and believe me, in vintage/legacy, speed is everything. \n\nI believe pretty much any of those formats, with decks that run 4 copies of [autocard]City of Brass[/autocard], they will run 4 copies of this too.

Unless you give it flash, they'll see it coming from a mile away (which can be useful, but not for removal purposes).\n- [autocard]Reprisal[/autocard]: Pretty efficient and is better when dealing with big creatures than End, but doesn't take care of smaller utility creatures.\n- [autocard]Quarry Colossus[/autocard]: Doesn't remove it (though burying it can be better). Also costs [5WW] and is reliant on mono white or two-colours to be effective.\n- [autocard]Riddle of Lightning[/autocard]: Why not just flip a freakin' coin?\n- [autocard]Silence the Believers[/autocard]: Woah! Actually good removal! It's just hard to get since it's a rare.\n- [autocard]Spiteful Blow[/autocard]: Not bad at all. Just a little slow and costly.\n- [autocard]Starfall[/autocard]: Was [autocard]Punish the Enemy[/autocard] so broken?\n- [autocard]Banishing Light[/autocard]: Actually effective, few drawbacks. I'd go as far to say it's better than this.\n\nUpon looking through the whole set, there are a few better options, but not many. Most of them has some kind of \"fine print\" you have to read before you can kill a creature.",

Especially if you are running her in a [i]Constellation[/i] deck, since the Snakes are enchantments, too.\n\nHowever, five mana for a death toucher is a lot, which is what she'll end up being more often than not.\nWhich makes her comparably slow, even slower (and more expensive inthe long run) than the gods with higher casting costs that grant you their abilities without investing any additional mana.\n\nShe would have been perfect if the activation cost was [(B/G)] instead, and if there was a may-clause for putting the token onto the battlefield (so you could exile your opponent's creature cards without giving him tokens).",

Sadly, there are cards that make you discard better (Academy Raider, Ashioks Adept, Liliana's Reaver) and many better black cards of 6 cmc.  The only thing I can say for it is there's no better, semi-low rarity, 6 cmc black creature in this set - but you'd probably still be better just using another card, as it's a power that nearly demands a significant part of the deck support it.",
