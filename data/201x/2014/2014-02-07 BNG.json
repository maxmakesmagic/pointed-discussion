The problem with this counterspell is that generally blue decks don't have permanents on the board, and if they do, it's not enough to make for a very powerful X-counterspell. This spell can't be cast sooner than turn 3 and is very easy to play around if your opponent knows it's coming, since they can just count your devotion.

It also forces them to play whatever they draw, since they know it can be discarded at any time you choose, effectively locking them in top-deck mode. The text, &quot;Whenever you cast a spell that targets Ashiok's Adept, each opponent discards a card&quot;, doesn't just do what it says. It's a mind game as well, and you can't overlook that. The 1/3 body is pretty nice too. There are quite a few 2 power creatures in BotG that can clog up the board early. This card seems like it was carefully crafted, and I like that.<br /><br />3/5",

Switch it in for boros reckoner, a card that is bad against control decks.\n \nNow you cast what you want to cast, as usual, [autocard]Firedrinker Satyr[/autocard] into [autocard]Burning-Tree Emissary[/autocard], into [autocard]Gore-House Chainwalker[/autocard] into maybe a turn three [autocard]Ash Zealot[/autocard]. \nNow you have 7 power on the board, with Firedrinker Satyr negating a plus one Jace, Architect of Thought.  The control player will three for one you with Supreme Verdict. \nNow, cast Nyx Smith. If the Nyx smith survives, it will start to give you back a board presence without you actually spending cards to do that. \n\nIf you're splashing white, (what you definitely should, because [autocard]Chained to the rocks[/autocard] is necessary against [autocard]Desecration Demon[/autocard],) you can even protect the nyx smith with a  lategame Boros Charm.",

The ability to give all your creatures Hexproof while removing Hexproof from their creatures is insane.  Yes 8 mana is steep but do you think a 2/2 with this ability would not be an auto include in every green deck for 3?  Right now it is not hard to have 5 mana on turn 2 for green with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx\">Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name= Burning-Tree Emissary\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\" Burning-Tree Emissary\"> Burning-Tree Emissary</a> to cast <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor Colossus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Arbor Colossus\">Arbor Colossus</a>.  At 8 this requires 4 Emissaries to pull a turn 2 and another 2 green drop to pull a turn 3.  I assume that Wizard originally play tested this card at 6 like the <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype of Finality\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Archetype of Finality\">Archetype of Finality</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype of Imagination\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Archetype of Imagination\">Archetype of Imagination</a> and found it too easy to get out on turn 3.  At that point it leaves most standard decks with 8 or more dead draws.  I think this is fair priced given the cards in standard, mostly because of Emissary.",

Yea, Hero's Downfall, Doom Blade and Detention Sphere are going to hit... but surviving 2/3 of the removal used in Standard, as a THREE MANA CREATURE, is fantastic. Yes, she can be hit by enchantment removal, but really, who mainboards that? Speaking of survival, she's an absolute wall against aggro decks. They aren't getting through her. <br /><br />B) Not only is she durable as hell, but she is USEFUL! She isn't mana ramp, no, but she is still card advantage in MULTIPLE ways. The first is that she thins out lands from your deck to help you reach solutions faster. In GREEN. Seriously, that is valuable. On TOP of that, she allows you to not waste your Scry Lands.

You are bringing the beats if you are playing her, and they know your gonna have a handful of either mana creatures or pain. <br /><br />C) As if that wasn't enough, she gives you life back. While that doesn't seem nearly as useful, consider this. Your Shock Lands? Yea, now they only cost one life. Have two of these beauties on the field? Your Shock Lands are now free, or +2 life.

Chromanticore feels like an entire vanilla cycle jammed onto one card, none of the abilities feels very special because they've been overused to the point of boredom.\n\nThat said, this makes something huge.  If there is a greedy hexproof deck still it wants to try to get this into play.  While there isn't the awesome synergy that would have been first strike, deathtouch and trample; lifelink and vigilance mean that the manticore will be very hard to race once it does hit play.\n\nIt's really a shame this was designed in the no on board effects era.  Looking at Cromat and knowing Chromaticore is a mythic manticore, it would have been cool to see what activated abilities they would give a five color version of a typically busted tribe.  Regeneration and shooting, but what else?\n\nFor all of the people wondering how to get this out, just run a playset of Chromatic Lanterns.  ",

   "text_posted": "@ DeckMechanic, it can't target itself. It says \"Another target permanent\", implying anything but this. If you had two of them, that could work.\n\nOtherwise, this is a beast in limited. When you're looking at your opponents untapped lands, you don't think about this as a source of mana at first. \n\nFor example, I was playing a guy who played this on turn two. He didn't play a land on turn 3, and he didn't play anything. \"Excellent\", I thought. \"I can play [autocard]Fabled Hero[/autocard] and still have the [1] to pay for [autocard]Stymied Hopes[/autocard]\". I didn't consider him technically having 3 mana for [autocard]Dissolve[/autocard], since it just looks like he's got 2 untapped mana.\n\nThe best combat trick is this and [autocard]Pheres-Band Tromper[/autocard]. If you attack with the tromper and they have a 3/3 to block, they'll block it. It sucks for them because now your tromper's a 4/4... and it's untapped.\n\nA definite champion of this set.",

Not as imaginative as some of the other gods though. Fun times with [b][autocard]Duskmantle Guildmage[/autocard][/b] since all those abilities can be used during the end step before your turn allowing you to block, then deal damage with mill.",

According to my quick search, in the sets since Shards of Alara, there's about a 3% chance for rares and 25% chance for mythics of getting a legendary creature (although there has been a lot of variance from those averages from set to set). Not very good odds for any relatively new casual player who only gets one or two dozen packs a set and doesn't trade or buy singles.
