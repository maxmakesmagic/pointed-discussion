   "text_posted": "There are some underpowered cards in Vraska's deck that will do surprisingly well due to the way that Jace's deck is built. This is a powerful card that will do surprisingly badly for the same reason.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a fantastic beater and there are plenty of decktypes that it will defeat almost singlehandedly, even against talented players... but Jace's Duel Deck is probably not one of them.\n\nJace has four counterspells (all of which can target the Kudzu), four bounce-type spells which will reset the Kudzu's +1/+1 counters, and four other noncreature spells that can steal or incapacitate the Kudzu in some way.\n\nEarly game the Kudzu will be kept at bay by these spells, and lategame it'll be outclassed by Jace's larger Illusion creatures. If nothing else, this guy will act as a lightning rod to provide cover for some of your other resources.\n\nBad match-up, excellent card. Glad to have it in the pack just for the sake of getting one.",
