   "text_posted": "I always, and still, think Frogmite is slightly stupid flavorwise. It's...a frog? is that Necrogen or Blinkmoth infusion inside it? It looks frosty? It's a FROG artifact? :P Really? :P\n\nBut Good Lord, I just can't argue with Results O.O I downright wouldn't play this guy when I was a new Magic player and flavor and Timmy was all that mattered. But that has Changed. I really want to play a deck with [autocard]Arcbound Ravager[/autocard] in it. I understand that that deck will need to play four of these. I don't entirely look forward to casting the little Frogmite, I still wish they had made an \"Arcbound\" creature with the Affinity ability. It would have been cool. \n\nBut I will greatly enjoy building and bashing with one of the greatest Decks in all of MAGIC. None of the good Onslaught or Odyssey or Invasion decks actually made people quit. Affinity, Caw-Blade, and Urza's Block share a distinguished position in MTG History: \n\nEven the other Stupid Decks Hate how Stupid they are! ^_^ I believe the product \"Archenemy\" was first made possible after the SECOND Great Screw Up of R&D: Affinity. Now, in the post Third Great Screw Up world (Jace/Caw Blade), we actually have a portion of our players who like it when WOTC Screws Up. We like it when we can build Archenemy Decks to machine gun the crap out of our friends. \n\nI wonder what the Fourth Great Screw Up will be? :) ",

Cast it to untap one of your own creatures after attacking with it.<br />3. Cast it targeting your own land to untap it, basically making it cost one less mana that you can use on something at instant speed (<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path to Exile\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Path to Exile\">Path to Exile</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighting Bolt\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lighting Bolt\">Lighting Bolt</a> ready in your opponent's turn).<br />4.
