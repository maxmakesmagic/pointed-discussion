A Savannah Lion, on the other hand, is a 2/1 for W that excels mainly in White Weenie decks whose main objective is to kill and kill fast.\n\nStill, pensively I yearn for a day when an ability such as this--and the card itself, though that may be too deep of a dream--will be printed as common so I can build a Pauper deck around it. Soul Sisters just isn't the same without this lifegaining-Tarmogoyf-esque creature. ",

   "text_parsed": "It should be noted that using Derevi's activated ability does not count as &quot;casting&quot; her, so it's <u>not</u> a combo with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opal Palace\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Opal Palace\">Opal Palace</a>. It does, however, evade countermagic such as the much-hated <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinder\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Hinder\">Hinder</a>.<br /><br />Now, I have an axe to grind with Derevi. Being in the same colors as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rafiq of the Many\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rafiq of the Many\">Rafiq of the Many</a> poses quite the deckbuilding question, mostly because Rafiq is such a bonkers card when paired with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Finest Hour\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Finest Hour\">Finest Hour</a> and now <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Medomai the Ageless\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Medomai the Ageless\">Medomai the Ageless</a>.<br />So, what does Derevi do that Rafiq doesn't do better? For starters, she always costs four mana, making her a relentless attacker and an expendable blocker in times of need. If we delve into the mechanics of her triggered ability, Derevi also emphasizes much more on creating an actual army than Rafiq, who tends to focus on the lone attacker breaking people's faces.  Derevi especially functions well with cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True Conviction\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"True Conviction\">True Conviction</a>, because giving all of your creatures double strike lets you get more out of Derevi's ability than simply using it for pseudo-vigilance or creating openings in your opponents' defenses for your allies to exploit. While Bant traditionally doesn't take multiple attack steps on the same turn, the shard has access to all of the most powerful &quot;take extra turns&quot; spells, and with the ability to untap two permanents for every attacker hitting an opponent, you'll have plenty of opportunity to untap your mana on your second main phase and cast a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time Warp\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Time Warp\">Time Warp</a> or similar. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror-Sigil Sergeant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mirror-Sigil Sergeant\">Mirror-Sigil Sergeant</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight of New Alara\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Knight of New Alara\">Knight of New Alara</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flurry of Wings\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Flurry of Wings\">Flurry of Wings</a> are some of the cards I'd consider if going for this type of strategy with Derevi.<br /><br />Another way to play Derevi, aside from the swarm approach, could be a focus on blink effects and tap/untap effects.

   "text_posted": "It should be noted that using Derevi's activated ability does not count as \"casting\" her, so it's [u]not[/u] a combo with [autocard]Opal Palace[/autocard]. It does, however, evade countermagic such as the much-hated [autocard]Hinder[/autocard].\n\nNow, I have an axe to grind with Derevi. Being in the same colors as [autocard]Rafiq of the Many[/autocard] poses quite the deckbuilding question, mostly because Rafiq is such a bonkers card when paired with [autocard]Finest Hour[/autocard] and now [autocard]Medomai the Ageless[/autocard].\nSo, what does Derevi do that Rafiq doesn't do better? For starters, she always costs four mana, making her a relentless attacker and an expendable blocker in times of need. If we delve into the mechanics of her triggered ability, Derevi also emphasizes much more on creating an actual army than Rafiq, who tends to focus on the lone attacker breaking people's faces.  Derevi especially functions well with cards like [autocard]True Conviction[/autocard], because giving all of your creatures double strike lets you get more out of Derevi's ability than simply using it for pseudo-vigilance or creating openings in your opponents' defenses for your allies to exploit. While Bant traditionally doesn't take multiple attack steps on the same turn, the shard has access to all of the most powerful \"take extra turns\" spells, and with the ability to untap two permanents for every attacker hitting an opponent, you'll have plenty of opportunity to untap your mana on your second main phase and cast a [autocard]Time Warp[/autocard] or similar. [autocard]Mirror-Sigil Sergeant[/autocard], [autocard]Knight of New Alara[/autocard] and [autocard]Flurry of Wings[/autocard] are some of the cards I'd consider if going for this type of strategy with Derevi.\n\nAnother way to play Derevi, aside from the swarm approach, could be a focus on blink effects and tap/untap effects.

And Derevi's a Wizard itself too. The fact that its original cost (and replay cost) are so low means that with a good mana filterer and something that can tap for a lot of mana, this thing can be free, or even produce mana on cast.

This also means that Derevi is a huge source of card advantage-whereas a normal general, even a cheap one, can be killed over and over again until its owner can't cast it, you can't stop your opponents from playing Derevi except by stopping them from hitting 4 lands (pretty hard to reliably do in Commander). Any half-decent sacrifice effect will absolutely break Derevi, granting you infinite of whatever you want over the course of the game with almost no way for your opponents to interact with it. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voidmage Prodigy\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Voidmage Prodigy\">Voidmage Prodigy</a> is probably the strongest of these, not letting your opponents ever cast a relevant spell as long as you have a few lands out.

Otherwise, she's just an overpriced [autocard]Pestermite[/autocard].\n\n-She loves any and all creatures that are both evasive and give you more spells to cast with the stuff you untap. From the included [autocard]Lu Xun[/autocard] to my personal favorites, [autocard]Thada Adel[/autocard] and her bff [autocard]Daxos[/autocard].\n\nI can't speak to her competitive-ness, but she wins [i]me[/i] games. And she's incredibly fun. (Except for her lockdown builds. I'm looking at you, [autocard]Static Orb[/autocard].)",

   "text_parsed": "I love the art and the theme, I think I will be adding her to my arsenal, but she has some real issues you need to address to make her an effective general. Here are some observations on her:<br /><br />1.) She has no protection or haste, but needs to attack to get in a useful effect. If an opponent sees her exile something powerful, she will be murdered mercilessly. The deck includes a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swiftfoot boots\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Swiftfoot boots\">Swiftfoot boots</a> but almost no other means of protecting her. I would aim for a couple more protective equipments. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning Greaves\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lightning Greaves\">Lightning Greaves</a> is the most obvious. She won't function well as a voltron general, but you want to get her safe and attacking the turn she arrives.<br /><br />2.) Keeping her safe isn't a huge deal. I know this contradicts my first point a bit, but don't be worried about her dying as long as you get your mana's worth. You want her to survive long enough to net you a few good spells for free, then when the good stuff's gone, let her die and bring her back for a new stash. Bonus points if you use her to cast a field-wipe. (<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree of Pain\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Decree of Pain\">Decree of Pain</a>!) <i>Just remember that she can only cast spells that were exiled the last time she entered the battlefield.</i> Cards don't remember what they did before zone changes. (Except <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullbriar, the Walking Grave\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Skullbriar, the Walking Grave\">Skullbriar, the Walking Grave</a>)<br /><br />3.) Make your deck function without her. A big advantage I see in her is that a deck built around her does not necessary need her to win. What you need is a deck where your win-cons are instants and sorceries. Obviously you want more of a strategy, but the important part is that the high end of your mana-curve is mostly spells she can bring out and sling for free. Copy effects are great as well since the only thing better than 13 zombies for <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=0&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"0\" align=\"absbottom\" /> is 26 zombies for <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" />.<br /><br />4.) She does not lower your card quality (statistically). This is a misconception I see on a lot of milling cards. Assuming your library is random and you won't be searching through it (No tutoring), and you won't run out of cards, there is no real downside to milling. She is just as likely to improve the card quality of your deck by removing things as she is to decrease it. It feels crappy when you lose a great bomb to mill, but just like there should be no difference drawing from the top or bottom of your library, taking four off the top doesn't effect your odds assuming drawing is all you do. <br /><br />5.) She is not great for milling. She just isn't. Her mill effect is to everyone, which is cool, and it exiles, but its also a 1 to 1 ratio with mana spent. Total cards milled with her on each summon go: 4,10,18,28, 40, 54,70,88. That is 8 summons with the last one costing 18 mana. Doable? Yes. but not very efficient. I am sure if thats the strategy you are going for you should be able to get your opponents out before then, thats more the max times you can summon her before its suicide. The issue in my opinion is that there aren't many big mill bomb spells to cast with her. Traumatize is always there, but is worse and worse the later you pull it out. Other big, non- spells are <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind Funeral\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mind Funeral\">Mind Funeral</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archive Trap\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Archive Trap\">Archive Trap</a>, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared Trauma\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Shared Trauma\">Shared Trauma</a>. It just lacks the bombs damage does in an instant/sorcery deck since most game ending mill spells seem to be X costers<br />",

You want her to survive long enough to net you a few good spells for free, then when the good stuff's gone, let her die and bring her back for a new stash. Bonus points if you use her to cast a field-wipe. ([autocard]Decree of Pain[/autocard]!) [i]Just remember that she can only cast spells that were exiled the last time she entered the battlefield.[/i] Cards don't remember what they did before zone changes. (Except [autocard]Skullbriar, the Walking Grave[/autocard])\n\n3.) Make your deck function without her. A big advantage I see in her is that a deck built around her does not necessary need her to win. What you need is a deck where your win-cons are instants and sorceries. Obviously you want more of a strategy, but the important part is that the high end of your mana-curve is mostly spells she can bring out and sling for free. Copy effects are great as well since the only thing better than 13 zombies for [0] is 26 zombies for [2].\n\n4.) She does not lower your card quality (statistically). This is a misconception I see on a lot of milling cards. Assuming your library is random and you won't be searching through it (No tutoring), and you won't run out of cards, there is no real downside to milling. She is just as likely to improve the card quality of your deck by removing things as she is to decrease it. It feels crappy when you lose a great bomb to mill, but just like there should be no difference drawing from the top or bottom of your library, taking four off the top doesn't effect your odds assuming drawing is all you do. \n\n5.) She is not great for milling. She just isn't. Her mill effect is to everyone, which is cool, and it exiles, but its also a 1 to 1 ratio with mana spent. Total cards milled with her on each summon go: 4,10,18,28, 40, 54,70,88. That is 8 summons with the last one costing 18 mana. Doable? Yes. but not very efficient. I am sure if thats the strategy you are going for you should be able to get your opponents out before then, thats more the max times you can summon her before its suicide. The issue in my opinion is that there aren't many big mill bomb spells to cast with her. Traumatize is always there, but is worse and worse the later you pull it out. Other big, non-[x] spells are [autocard]Mind Funeral[/autocard], [autocard]Archive Trap[/autocard], and [autocard]Shared Trauma[/autocard]. It just lacks the bombs damage does in an instant/sorcery deck since most game ending mill spells seem to be X costers\n",

In fact, if you ever actually throw Oloro into the field, either you are doing it wrong or you are totally gassed on cards.<br /><br />Oloro is best used in a deck that wants to use its life as a resource. Necro is a great example.

Oloro gives you a buffer such that your opponents can't just kill you with a bunch of angry solemn simulacrums; they'll have to kill you with their primary win cons (general damage, infinite combos, etc.). Toxic Deluge is another example.

   "text_parsed": "I really wish Prossh was worded more like Jeleva. Jeleva's wording is that when she etb's, only then do you exile cards equal to the mana spent to cast her. This means that if you counter her, the cards don't get exiled. You can also Torpor Orb/Humility Jeleva to stop the exile trigger.<br /><br />With Prossh's wording you will get the tokens even if he gets countered (you need to stifle the token producing ability), and playing Humility/Torpor Orb doesn't stop the player from getting tokens either, and it's so difficult to deal with the tokens in a properly designed Prossh deck. The only efficient way to deal with the tokens is to kill them pre-emptively, such as with Elesh Norn or Curse of Death's Hold, because if you play a cheap sweeper after Prossh is out, a good Prossh player will have extra sac outlets to still get a bonus. Because Prossh is also his own sacrifice outlet, it's much harder to deal with any other creatures on his field. I think Cartel Aristocrat has proven how strong sac outlets are, and that's a boring bear, while Prossh is a 5/5 dragon smasher.<br /><br />The big thing with Prossh is of course the tokens. For example, Food Chain + Prossh is infinite mana because you can sac tokens for 1 mana and Prossh brings more tokens everytime it's cast. Sadistic Hypnotist + Prossh = discard 14 cards (12 if you just sac 6 tokens). Purphoros + Prossh = each opponent takes 14 damage. Grave pact/dictate of erebos + Prossh = each opponent basically has no more creatures. Prossh + Fecundity = you draw a ton of cards. And that's just scratching the surface. But the other problem is that even if you can deal with the tokens or the engines in the deck, Prossh is still a 5/5 flier with a cheap power pump.<br /><br />Prossh isn't broken because it doesn't have blue and therefore has no access to counterspells, but in multiplayer EDH it's shaping up to be a top tier general, I'd say at least a top 10 general. There are many ways to build Prossh and it takes multiple spells in succession to knock a Prossh deck out of the game. It's hard to efficiently deal with Prossh because it's resilient, but it can also be explosive.<br /><br />The only way to take out a Prossh deck is either be a faster combo deck (not easy to do since Prossh decks often win the moment they cast Prossh or 1 turn after, assuming there's no disruption) or be a stax deck that restricts mana. If you can kill Prossh the first time and then lock down that player's mana, he won't reach 8-mana to recast Prossh and often that knocks him out of the game. If you just try to trade 1-for-1 blows with the Prossh deck, it'll come out on top because of how much value every Prossh cast generates. Tucking Prossh isn't even a great solution either because BG gives many good tutors to get him back out (demonic/vampiric tutor, fauna shaman, survival of the fittest, birthing pod, etc).",

For example, when casting <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempt With Vengeance\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Tempt With Vengeance\">Tempt With Vengeance</a>, you can turn to another player at the table and tell him that if he accepts the offer, you will not attack him with the Elementals this turn. If he accepts, you might have enough elementals to take out another player at the table, where you didn't previously. Sure, you gave your opponent creatures, but there are any number of ways you can deal with that. Maybe you are holding a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scouring Sands\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Scouring Sands\">Scouring Sands</a> or an <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim's Prayer\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Orim's Prayer\">Orim's Prayer</a>, or you simply have a high enough life total to take the risk.<br /><br />Even beyond politics, the cards are designed to be <i>fun</i>, because they can potentially create huge, board-altering effects. Sure, there may be simpler ways to <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Clone\">Clone</a> a creature you control than <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempt with Reflections\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Tempt with Reflections\">Tempt with Reflections</a>, if making one copy of a creature is your goal.

None of his more interesting creatures and spells used their 'neato' Johnny abilities. They didn't have to. Esper deck comes with plenty of Lifelink, Deathtouch, +1/+1 counters, and that one particular Well artifact basically shuts down Nekusar and turned my own deck into his best resource. <br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx of the Steel Wind\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sphinx of the Steel Wind\">Sphinx of the Steel Wind</a> beat the ever living hell out of me and he gained more than enough life to support himself because of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filigree Angel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Filigree Angel\">Filigree Angel</a>. <br /><br />2. The decks were fresh-out-box, so hastily shuffled, and I declared that since we were about to be late for dinner and wanted to get the game done kind of fast, we should start with the rule that you can play 1 non-basic land AND 1 basic land a turn. He calculated more accurately that the decks were 40% land instead of my hastily assumed 30% land, so his pre-game shuffling was better, and this did make the early game already look bad for me, but in truth even though he gained land advantage, by the time he gained board and card advantage on me, I was at a perfectly reasonably land set up myself. I had played <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prosperity\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Prosperity\">Prosperity</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyscribing\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Skyscribing\">Skyscribing</a>, so I had plenty of opportunity to draw into good things.

May this never happen to you. <br /><br />4. If you want to play Commander 2013 out of the box, and you want to play Grixis vs. Esper, I strongly recommend putting Thraximundar in the Command Zone. The Artifact Deck is so Boss that I feel an all-out assault that ignores subtlety and strategy for Maximum Brute Force is where your hope lies. He was able to beat me with Sphinx of the Steel Wind, because I had to use my best removal on Sharuum, and BOTH Sphinxes were essentially &quot;Blue-White Artifact Shivan Dragons' in terms of what impact their card texts had on the game.

It would be *plausible* to see this reprinted as quickly as THAT. Maybe.<br /><br />The thing is, it's a 3-drop, which is great, but Merfolk DOES have such a low curve that it really wants to question whether it has room or not for a playset when it's got <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reejerey\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Reejerey\">Reejerey</a> to think of, too. If it were a two-drop, I think it would be close to as fair as it is as 3-drop, PLUS I wouldn't remotely question the $40 tag because you just throw that in no questions asked. At 3 mana, it's feasible that not every Fish player will even use him.<br /><br />It makes Merfolk good, definitely. But it doesn't automatically make Merfolk &quot;The Best Deck in Legacy&quot;, and for that I'm thinking it's closer to $25-30, than it is to &quot;$30 is the bargain bin rate&quot;",

Golgari are *particularly* well-known for -X/-X stuff, ever since [autocard]Pernicious Deed[/autocard]. It would be *plausible* to see this reprinted as quickly as THAT. Maybe.\n\nThe thing is, it's a 3-drop, which is great, but Merfolk DOES have such a low curve that it really wants to question whether it has room or not for a playset when it's got [autocard]Reejerey[/autocard] to think of, too. If it were a two-drop, I think it would be close to as fair as it is as 3-drop, PLUS I wouldn't remotely question the $40 tag because you just throw that in no questions asked. At 3 mana, it's feasible that not every Fish player will even use him.\n\nIt makes Merfolk good, definitely. But it doesn't automatically make Merfolk \"The Best Deck in Legacy\", and for that I'm thinking it's closer to $25-30, than it is to \"$30 is the bargain bin rate\"",
