Possibly telling you which mana ramp colour this would work best in? \n\nI wish they could have included some flavour text... This is a mythic after all...\n\nStrong and versatile card. I'm sure this will find a solid home in some strong constructed decks. \n\nSomeone compared this to [autocard]Planar Portal[/autocard]. The extra 1 mana to drop it and play it is very steep... This comes out and activates much faster.. and if you can't win the game after tutoring for any three cards, you're doing it wrong....",

I'm so much of a Vorthos that I really care and appreciate the work that goes into the Planeswalker Bio pages on the Mothership. *Karn Liberated actually has an awesome one) You know all those tabs that don't even ever have spoilers under them? I always click all of them to check for new Vorthos content. It wasn't even until Knowledge Pool came out that I became ANY sort of Johnny AT ALL. that card just kinda changed me. I suck at building decks unless they're bad silly decks like Knowledge Pool, okay? <br /><br />I didn't mean on other Sliver posts to sound too much like a Complete Hater. I know that I must have seemed pretty blowhard. I just feel....Lost, and Rejected, and Abandoned to be a Vorthos these days. <br /><br />When I started the game, it was sometime when my only Magic-playing friend had mostly Ravnica and Time Spiral stuff, and my first product was Xth Edition and Lorwyn. AT THAT TIME, this &quot;Mending&quot; thing was to me, one of the coolest stories I'd ever heard in the history of Ever Ever. They say new players were 'lost and confused' by Time Spiral flavor. I was lost and confused in the sense that I was on pot: THERE WAS SO MUCH TO LEARN and I just didn't have time to do it- I didn't get half the references til years later after hours of reading and research. . . . . so. x3  Time Spiral ROCKED for Vorthoses, and for kids who like to get high on silly game lore. :) Wasn't till FTV started coming out really that I understood half of it XD (If you don't own them: buy the Artifacts Cycle 1 and 2. worth much more than the equivalent of sealed product of any set, PRE or POST Modern.)<br /><br />But-- I've since come to realize that the Mending might be the very worst thing to happen to Magic. I don't mind the Planeswalker card type is busted. I grew up on the Egyptian God Cards. Planeswalkers need to be MORE busted and should have been made into cards a lot sooner XD<br /><br />I have read WOTC articles since what seems like forever (actually just since Shadowmoor) and have swallowed half of their explanations, and the other half the time emailed in to get better ones (and usually got them!) <br /><br />If you look at everything else they've done...it kind of makes sense? It certainly SEEMS to make sense to, I think, anyone that has been with the game from Xth Edition onward and has kept an open mind and heart about things. At FIRST, it seemed like Vorthos was getting Extra Special Treatment in Lorwyn and Shards of Alara. <br /><br />Zendikar though? Zendikar was definitely the point where &quot;Plane-hopping&quot; and &quot;Worldbuilding&quot; became the new &quot;What we get instead of Vorthos&quot; which should be &quot;Characters&quot; and &quot;Plots&quot;. If I want Civilizations: the Gathering, I'll read real history and find out what actual societies look like when they're not made up, because most Planes are ridiculous from a &quot;Worldbuilding&quot; view. BUT HEROES AND MONSTERS AND MAGIC AND VILLAINS MAKE THAT PERFECTLY OKAY! As long as you actually write enough about them!<br /><br />I DEVOURED the Planeswalker Webcomics and intend to start collecting the Dack Fayden comics soon.<br />Gatheringmagic.com even had their own special Vorthos column tailor made to talk about stuff WOTC didn't. For a while, at the HEIGHT of Planeswalker AWESOMENESS (sometime very much close to when they made Jace the FACE OF MAGIC), it WAS good to be a Vorthos. <br /><br />But I've noticed something. The Block Novels stopped. Curse of the Chain Veil got cancelled. Savor the Flavor itself got the axe. The Planeswalker Novels and Webcomics, the NEW replacement for Urza-era Vorthos, nope, not doing them anymore.  It only just occurred to me how very little I care about <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska the Unseen\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vraska the Unseen\">Vraska the Unseen</a>. Considering that I'm a Vorthos, and she's a Planeswalker, it's inexcusable that there's so little Vorthos content supporting her. Tamiyo still doesn't have Vorthos support. Nissa Revane got a whole novel focused on her, and it only served to show how completely a failure she was as a Planeswalker. Considering how old elves should be, I don't know why she's dumber than Chandra Nalaar.<br /><br />And the unanswered questions from previous blocks? How many months, which is now YEARS in a row that I've mailed in about The Eldrazi? About Nicol Bolas? About the Phyrexians? <br /><br />-Scars of Mirrodin and forward, we can give a pass saying that 'it's coming, just wait for it'.  BUT! WHY have they not given ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT that they even remember the Eldrazi EXIST?! DOESN'T. COMPUTE. And now they do these New Slivers? They have had enough years for some kind of reference to be made to an event that supposedly threatened the entire existence of the cosmos and has not been acted on in any appreciable way, for enough years that numerous &quot;We forgot that happened&quot; SuperVillains should have eaten everyone ages ago.<br /><br />Wizards of the Coast is at best apathetic to Vorthos. It's not just about the Slivers. It's NOT. JUST. THE SLIVERS.<br /><br /><br />-Vorthos, the Lost Psychographic. ",

I was lost and confused in the sense that I was on pot: THERE WAS SO MUCH TO LEARN and I just didn't have time to do it- I didn't get half the references til years later after hours of reading and research. . . . . so. x3  Time Spiral ROCKED for Vorthoses, and for kids who like to get high on silly game lore. :) Wasn't till FTV started coming out really that I understood half of it XD (If you don't own them: buy the Artifacts Cycle 1 and 2. worth much more than the equivalent of sealed product of any set, PRE or POST Modern.)\n\nBut-- I've since come to realize that the Mending might be the very worst thing to happen to Magic. I don't mind the Planeswalker card type is busted. I grew up on the Egyptian God Cards. Planeswalkers need to be MORE busted and should have been made into cards a lot sooner XD\n\nI have read WOTC articles since what seems like forever (actually just since Shadowmoor) and have swallowed half of their explanations, and the other half the time emailed in to get better ones (and usually got them!) \n\nIf you look at everything else they've done...it kind of makes sense? It certainly SEEMS to make sense to, I think, anyone that has been with the game from Xth Edition onward and has kept an open mind and heart about things. At FIRST, it seemed like Vorthos was getting Extra Special Treatment in Lorwyn and Shards of Alara. \n\nZendikar though? Zendikar was definitely the point where \"Plane-hopping\" and \"Worldbuilding\" became the new \"What we get instead of Vorthos\" which should be \"Characters\" and \"Plots\". If I want Civilizations: the Gathering, I'll read real history and find out what actual societies look like when they're not made up, because most Planes are ridiculous from a \"Worldbuilding\" view. BUT HEROES AND MONSTERS AND MAGIC AND VILLAINS MAKE THAT PERFECTLY OKAY! As long as you actually write enough about them!\n\nI DEVOURED the Planeswalker Webcomics and intend to start collecting the Dack Fayden comics soon.\nGatheringmagic.com even had their own special Vorthos column tailor made to talk about stuff WOTC didn't. For a while, at the HEIGHT of Planeswalker AWESOMENESS (sometime very much close to when they made Jace the FACE OF MAGIC), it WAS good to be a Vorthos. \n\nBut I've noticed something. The Block Novels stopped. Curse of the Chain Veil got cancelled. Savor the Flavor itself got the axe. The Planeswalker Novels and Webcomics, the NEW replacement for Urza-era Vorthos, nope, not doing them anymore.  It only just occurred to me how very little I care about [autocard]Vraska the Unseen[/autocard]. Considering that I'm a Vorthos, and she's a Planeswalker, it's inexcusable that there's so little Vorthos content supporting her. Tamiyo still doesn't have Vorthos support. Nissa Revane got a whole novel focused on her, and it only served to show how completely a failure she was as a Planeswalker. Considering how old elves should be, I don't know why she's dumber than Chandra Nalaar.\n\nAnd the unanswered questions from previous blocks? How many months, which is now YEARS in a row that I've mailed in about The Eldrazi? About Nicol Bolas? About the Phyrexians? \n\n-Scars of Mirrodin and forward, we can give a pass saying that 'it's coming, just wait for it'.  BUT! WHY have they not given ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT that they even remember the Eldrazi EXIST?! DOESN'T. COMPUTE. And now they do these New Slivers? They have had enough years for some kind of reference to be made to an event that supposedly threatened the entire existence of the cosmos and has not been acted on in any appreciable way, for enough years that numerous \"We forgot that happened\" SuperVillains should have eaten everyone ages ago.\n\nWizards of the Coast is at best apathetic to Vorthos. It's not just about the Slivers. It's NOT. JUST. THE SLIVERS.\n\n\n-Vorthos, the Lost Psychographic. ",

What are people's favorite White- or Black- ways to gain repeated life points in EDH? :)\n\n(Also, I like the [autocard]Bubbling Cauldron[/autocard] idea. [autocard]Kaalia[/autocard] would be an ideal place for Vorthos to justify this flavor paradox!)\n\n\nNo Gatherer, I am never, ever, ever going to shut up about [autocard]Kaalia of the Vast[/autocard]. She is too damn awesome. AND YOU ALL KNOW IT. But I will endeavor to find many different ways to build her so it doesn't get boring, and especially so it doesn't look lazy x3 ",

Just like Ferlord, you're making the mistake of thinking that cards in your deck are a limited resource.\n\nUnless you're playing tutors (or playing against mill) it doesn't matter that 9 random cards are missing from your deck.  Not to mention that if you actually get it to work, you've probably won.",

There are enough aggro and midrange decks where every card has to immediately do something if you want to keep up the tempo. In general, planeswalkers that can protect themselves are always the ones that excel. Look at how PWs like Sarkhan Vol and Gideon champion of justice are awful because they don't have abilities that protect themselves. Look at how PWs like Elspeth and Jace 2.0 and Liliana of the Veil are good becuase they have abilities that do (there are of course a few exceptions. Koth is an exception because he was very strong in RDW particularly because he could threaten his ultimate 2 turns after he was dropped. Jace Beleren was also an exception because he was only 3 mana so you could afford to play a 3drop and not directly impact the board, but he's horrendous vs aggro).<br /><br />How does this relate to Chandra?<br /><br />The problem with this Chandra is that, much like Firebrand, her 2nd ability is very bad when you drop her on turn 4 (or just as early as possible). It's not an actual draw, and going T4 Chandra and 0'ing doesn't do anything because you can't play the exiled because you won't have mana open. You'd have to T5 untap, use 0 ability and then choose to play off the top or not.  Yes, if you are in the lategame and you have a ton of mana open, then topdeck Chandra, you can play her and 0 and probably play whatever is on the top, but there are only few planeswalkers that are bad topdecks, so that isn't saying much. This means that, on the turn you drop Chandra, her 0 ability is not good at doing anything, much less protect herself. <br /><br />Her 0 ability is also bad in a control deck because it's entirely possible to not only exile something useful, but you can only use the exiled card on your turn and control decks just want to play draw-go. For example, if your UWR flash deck exiled a sphinx's rev, how often will you tap out on your turn to use it and how often will you have to let it go?<br /><br />What this means is that her entire usefulness is basically based on her +1 ability. It's an upgrade from the +1 on firebrand, but it's only a small upgrade. Unless the format is swarming with X/1s, her +1 is not good at protecting herself. Note that the implications of &quot;that creature can't block this turn&quot; from her +1 is at odds with the idea of protecting herself, becuase in order to capitalize on an opponent's creature being unable to block, you need at least a creature around to swing in, which would leave Chandra wide open for a counter. Yes, you can make up scenarios where her +1 stops a blocker and you still have something(s) to leave back to defend, but if your board state is that good, any card that is 4+ mana would have a similar effect anyway. And if you won't attack with a creature then &quot;that creature can't block this turn&quot; becomes a worthless effect.<br /><br />She WILL see play in standard no matter what, even if she's just a bad red version of underworld connections (that card is boarded in vs control). But unless the format has a lot of X/1s where playing Chandra early, immediately +1 to kill something is a common play, she will never be really good. She will not be a PW like liliana of the veil, garruk relentless/primal hunter, or older PWs like elspeth where you can mainboard 2-4 copies and be happy, because Chandra is bad in enough matchups where that isn't going to work.",

   "text_parsed": "I understand the reasons for changing the wording; however, I prefer the old wording.  When I first started, I understood the way unblockable functioned, and it made sense--the card is not in a physical form, therefore it cannot be touched by any creature, hence it is unblockable.  Using the term &quot;unblockable&quot; was more flavorful than &quot;can't be blocked,&quot; so I liked it better.  In addition, I feel that saying &quot;can't be blocked&quot; may be somewhat confusing.  When you compare it to creatures with abilities such as fear and intimidate, it feels like the card is missing the end of its rules text, or that maybe it's supposed to function like intimidate.  In board states that contain both this and a creature with intimidate, it may become confusing and hard to keep track of because they both read &quot;can't be blocked,&quot; leading to confusion as to which creature can be blocked and which cannot.  The unblockable wording helped differentiate it from other similar cards.  Overall, I understand why they would change the wording, but I find that it complicates the matter more than it will help",
   "text_posted": "I understand the reasons for changing the wording; however, I prefer the old wording.  When I first started, I understood the way unblockable functioned, and it made sense--the card is not in a physical form, therefore it cannot be touched by any creature, hence it is unblockable.  Using the term \"unblockable\" was more flavorful than \"can't be blocked,\" so I liked it better.  In addition, I feel that saying \"can't be blocked\" may be somewhat confusing.

   "text_posted": "Honestly, I think this would be amazing for most green EDH decks: it gives you a lot of small advantages, and like, say, [autocard]Lifegift[/autocard], other people won't see the small advantages as a big threat (after all, there's that[autocard] Phyrexian Colossus[/autocard]/[autocard]Grave Betrayal[/autocard]/[autocard]Necropotence[/autocard]/[autocard]Grave Pact[/autocard] on the other guy's board, why bother destroying the puny little Lifegift that's not actually doing all that much compared to other stuff?). Point in case is that, like Lifegift, it tends to add up. Quickly.

Here's an actual Casual deck I've built that wins regularly on Turn 4.  God hand wins turn 2.  First, before the game, I pull out an unsleeved copy of Rod of Ruin and put it in the middle of the table.  After their look of confusion, I say, &quot;This is the face of your doom.&quot;  I leave it there while we play.  The look on their faces is priceless as they try to figure out how the heck something so &quot;bad&quot; could ever win.\r<br />\r<br />The combo is built like this:\r<br />1. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rings of Brighthearth\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rings of Brighthearth\">Rings of Brighthearth</a> + <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basalt Monolith\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Basalt Monolith\">Basalt Monolith</a> for unlimited colorless mana.\r<br />2. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei's Divining Top\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sensei's Divining Top\">Sensei's Divining Top</a> both to help you find the combo and to give you unlimited card draw once you have it.\r<br />3. Add <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic Key\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Voltaic Key\">Voltaic Key</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod of Ruin\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rod of Ruin\">Rod of Ruin</a> for the win.\r<br />\r<br />God hand:\r<br />Turn 1: Land. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol Ring\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sol Ring\">Sol Ring</a>. Key. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana Vault\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mana Vault\">Mana Vault</a>. Monolith. Top. Key untap Monolith. Rings. Use Top to arrange top three cards (just because you can).\r<br />Turn 2: Key untap Monolith, copy untap with Rings. Double tap Monolith. Monolith+Rings gives infinite mana. Top+Rings gives infinite card draw. Rod. Another Key. Rod+Key+Rings is infinite damage.\r<br />\r<br />Details:\r<br />1. With Rings, tapped Monolith, and 5 mana (3 of which could be from the Monolith), activate Monolith for 3 and copy the untap for 2.  First untap resolves and you tap the Monolith for 3.  Second untap resolves and you tap again for 3.  Now you have +1 mana from where you started.  Repeat as needed.\r<br />\r<br />2. With Rings, Top, and 3 mana, activate card draw of Top and copy with Rings.  First draw resolves and puts Top on deck.  Second draw resolves and puts Top back in hand.  Recast Top.  You just spent 3 mana to draw 1 card, and you have unlimited mana from Step 1.  Repeat as needed.\r<br />\r<br />3. With Rings, Key, Rod, and 8 mana, activate Rod for 3 and copy for 2.  Rod zaps twice.  Activate Key on itself and copy on Rod. Rod untaps, Key untaps.  You just spent 8 mana for 2 damage.  (OMG so broken!)  Lucky you have unlimited mana.  Repeat as needed.\r<br />\r<br />An important thing to note is that while you'll want 4 each of Rings, Monoliths, and Tops, you only need two copies of Key and one copy of Rod in your deck, so you're really not getting bogged down.  It's a 5-card combo, but it feels like a 2 or 3-card combo.\r<br />\r<br />It's all colorless and leaves more than 20 slots open for other cards so you can put it in any color you want.

   "text_parsed": "&quot;Now much of the speech of cats was known to Ajani, and in this far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable. But that he need not have done, for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer, and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions. The call of the clan had been given, and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it. The flutes stopped, and there were shrieks in the night.

Black, grey, and white; yellow, tiger, and mixed; common, Persian, and Marix; Thibetan, Angora, and Egyptian; all were there in the fury of battle, and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of Bubastis. They would leap seven strong at the throat of an almost-human or the pink tentacled snout of a toad-thing and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain, where myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine battle-fury.

The call of the clan had been given, and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it. The flutes stopped, and there were shrieks in the night.

   "text_posted": "@wern212 Elixir helps out a lot against graveyard-hate decks, especially in EDH. With cards like Rest in Peace, Tormod's Crypt, Bojuka Bog, and Relic of Progenitus, saving your graveyard plus the 5 life seems like a very good out to include. Also helps out late game when you're running out of answers in your deck. It's high rating now, however, is probably due to Scavenging Ooze's reprint in Standard. Though the card itself is more likely kept in sideboards.",

XD\n\nOh and [autocard]Primeval Titan[/autocard] is a 6/6. And this is a 5/5. So that is why Primeval Titan is banned in Commander @___@\n\nAND. DO YOU EVEN REALIZE. THE ONLY PART OF THIS CREATURE WE CAN SEE IS THE FRONT-MOST END OF IT'S ABNORMALLY HUMONGOUS CRANIUM. FIRST OF ALL THERE IS MORE HEAD WE CANNOT SEE. \n\nTHEN THERE IS THE REST OF IT. \nAND. IT'S NOT. LEGENDARY?!?!?!?    HOW MANY OF THESE......*****THINGS***** CAN EVEN FIT IN ONE FLIPPPING OCEAN?!?!? X__X",

Whether to do more Lorwyn Planeswalker Artifacts or more Alara Planeswalker Artifacts....that Is the question? :)\n\n\nOOH! OOH! \n\n\nSorin Markov's Abusively Excessive Large Sword....of REVENGE   10\n\nEquipped creature gets +20/+20 if the creature blocking it is pinned against a wall.\n\nEquip 0",

But what about a multicoloured deck where either card is a potential two-drop?<br /><br /><br /><u><b>Basic Selesnya</b></u><br /><br />(Kalonian Tusker Casting Odds: 23.91%, Watchwolf Casting Odds: 52.17%)<br /><br />Let's start simple with a basic Selesnya manabase: 12 Forests and 12 Plains. Assuming your opening hand contains two lands (plus the Tusker and Wolf), here are the possibilities:<br /><br />#1 - Forest, Forest: The Tusker is castable, the Wolf is not. (Score: 1/0 for the Tusker)<br />#2 - Plains, Plains: Neither the Tusker nor the Wolf are castable. (Score: 1/0 for the Tusker)<br />#3 - Forest, Plains: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Score: 1/1 Tie)<br />#4 - Plains, Forest: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Final Score: 1/2 for the Wolf)<br /><br />It's interesting to note that the odds of scenarios #1 or #2 happening are slightly lower than the odds of scenarios #3 or #4 happening. This is because drawing your second Forest or Plains is less likely once you've already taken one of the desired lands from the deck. On the contrary, finding a Plains after your first Forest or a Forest after your first Plains is <i>more</i> likely because the unwanted land has become less common in the deck. With this in mind, the Watchwolf's chances of being castable here on Turn 2 are actually slightly higher than the 50% &quot;coin toss&quot; chance that you might expect.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>Dual Selesnya</b></u><br /><br />(Kalonian Tusker Casting Odds: 42.63%, Watchwolf Casting Odds: 79.29%)<br /><br />Now let's try a more developed manabase: 8 Forests, 8 Plains, 8 <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253681\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"253681\">Temple Gardens</a>. Assuming that having 8 Temple Gardens is even legal here, and that your opening hand contains two lands (plus the Tusker and Wolf), here are the possibilities:<br /><br />#1 - Forest, Forest: The Tusker is castable, the Wolf is not.

(Score: 2/3 for the Wolf)<br />#6 - Forest, Temple Garden: Both the Tusker and the Wolf are castable.

(Score: 4/6 for the Wolf)<br />#9 - Temple Garden, Plains: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Final Score: 4/7 for the Wolf)<br /><br />Like in the Basic Selesnya example above, the Wolf gets a slight probability advantage over the Tusker due to the inherent difficulty associated with drawing multiples of a desired card. On top of this, it is very clear that the Wolf gathers more of an advantage from the use of dual lands than the Tusker does here.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>TL;DR</b></u><br /><br />If you're using a nonwhite deck or Beast Tribal or just something <i>very</i> green-heavy, go with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian Tusker\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kalonian Tusker\">Kalonian Tusker</a>.

With Vigilance (an ability White is best at giving), you can get around this. Diversion has no other way of tapping.\nDecoy doesn't need to attack to use his ability. Diversion has no other means of activating the ability. This can be particularly bad when your opponent has two big creatures versus just one.\nDecoy can tap any creature, while Diversion can only tap a creature controlled by the attacked. Can help you when you want something of yours to become tapped/targeted (maybe you have a [autocard]Yosei, the Morning Star[/autocard] and they're playing [autocard]Dismiss into Dreams[/autocard]? It could happen...)\nDecoy can be useful when you're attacking OR blocking. Diversion only works when you're attacking.\nUhh... Decoy's a soldier while Diversion's a scout.\n\nAll in all, both are decent creatures, it's just that Diversion isn't as versatile. \n\n",

Duh to both of the above. :P<br /><br /><br />The real comment: <br /><br />they're being conservative with Red card draw. <br /><br />this makes sense. Imagine if they woke up one day and said &quot;Blue needs better creatures because the game is all about creatures&quot; and started making even Uncommon Blues really good in limited at attacking and blocking. like a Blue Knight with protection from Green o_O <br />Obviously they would not start out with a Blue Knight as good as White Knight, because that's asking for trouble. Blue really needs very little, even when counterspells are bad, to dominate the entire game. Good creatures would do it, because card draw is <i>Always</i> Blue's Domain.<br /><br />right now, Red card draw is still weak-bad-sauce as a mechanic, with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless Looting\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Faithless Looting\">Faithless Looting</a> being really great as a card.<br /><br />Give them some years, they will tweak Red Card draw to where it should be. Better to do this slow than to give us an OP Red draw spell, because Draw is EXACTLY what RED wants to dominate the entire game. 1-drop spells + Card Draw Juice = GG, mate, since Green already contains cards which on average can supply you with extra mountains or extra red mana at a good rate. <br /><br />RUG was the first Broken Combo: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Channel\">Channel</a>-<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fireball\">Fireball</a>?

   "text_posted": "A. I really like the Flavor :) \n\nB. Card is Bad :/ \n\nC. Duh to both of the above. :P\n\n\nThe real comment: \n\nthey're being conservative with Red card draw. \n\nthis makes sense. Imagine if they woke up one day and said \"Blue needs better creatures because the game is all about creatures\" and started making even Uncommon Blues really good in limited at attacking and blocking. like a Blue Knight with protection from Green o_O \nObviously they would not start out with a Blue Knight as good as White Knight, because that's asking for trouble. Blue really needs very little, even when counterspells are bad, to dominate the entire game. Good creatures would do it, because card draw is [i]Always[/i] Blue's Domain.\n\nright now, Red card draw is still weak-bad-sauce as a mechanic, with [autocard]Faithless Looting[/autocard] being really great as a card.\n\nGive them some years, they will tweak Red Card draw to where it should be. Better to do this slow than to give us an OP Red draw spell, because Draw is EXACTLY what RED wants to dominate the entire game. 1-drop spells + Card Draw Juice = GG, mate, since Green already contains cards which on average can supply you with extra mountains or extra red mana at a good rate. \n\nRUG was the first Broken Combo: [autocard]Channel[/autocard]-[autocard]Fireball[/autocard]? Mostly worked because of [autocard]Ancestral Recall[/autocard].  We have MUCH better than Fireball to win games with, all the time now. Even [autocard]Shock[/autocard] might be better than Fireball, I'm not sure. We have much WORSE than Channel at making mana.....but Red does not really need as much mana as all that anymore. So it would be really really hard for RnD to make a mistake and print a Red Ancestral Recall, but, you know, it's because they care that they don't even give us Red [autocard]Divination[/autocard].\n\nIt always sucks to hear \"wait for it....\"\n\nbut sometimes, it's true, yo.",

Before, Blue control decks that don't run White didn't really have a way to restock their hand in a big way. Blue-white decks should run shinx's rev, no doubt, but if you DON'T run those colors, this is a spectacular alternative.",

Fantastic big creature, and a worthy addition to Green's signature tribe. Will never see Standard play, but I'm certainly going to pick up a few.",

If it makes sense (&quot;Can you solve this <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Capashen Knight\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Capashen Knight\">Capashen Knight</a>?&quot;), then it's a question.

You will be waiting for questions, or you won't have the right answer for the question at the time (there are only so many answers you can draft that solve many questions).<br /><br />A good limited deck has lots of questions and some answers.
