They're decent. But being CIPT-lands, i feel like they should have been uncommons only.\n\nShards of Alara's tricolor-taplands for instance were also uncommon. Zendikar's lifegain taplands were also uncommon. Admittedly, Zendikar had another rare cycle and was a land-centered Cycle, also had the rare CIPT-manlands in Worldwake, and scy is usually worth more than one life, [i]and[/i] there are going to be a couple of cards in Theros that interact with it (similar to how Onslaught's  [autocard]Astral Slide[/autocard] triggers with Cycling). BUT STILL.",
