   "text_parsed": "Browbeat really is disappointing. I see a lot of people across the &quot;punisher&quot; themed cards' comment sections arguing for their effectiveness by pointing out that each mode is heavily undercosted, but that comparison is irrelevant. You're not getting the mode you want, you're getting the mode you don't want, and whoever thinks that's irrelevant should consider the cases when you're playing the card. Most people here seem to like this card for a straight burn/RDW, so let's entertain some possibilities. <br /><br />Example 1: You're against a control player who has four cards in hand by turn 3. You have three cards in hand, this, a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Skullcrack\">Skullcrack</a>, and a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning Bolt\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lightning Bolt\">Lightning Bolt</a>, and three mountains in play. Let's say they've got a creature on the board that's giving you grief, e.g. a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling Mage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Meddling Mage\">Meddling Mage</a>, and you want it gone. Your opponent has two islands open. You would have to tap out to play the Browbeat, and there's no chance of sneaking it in at the end of their turn since it's a sorcery. Obviously any card can be countered, but getting a sorcery that costs all of your mana shut down leaves you completely flat-footed for your opponent's turn. It loses you both tempo and card advantage. You either sit on the Browbeat hoping for your opponent to tap out so you can play it on a future turn and play your other two cards with your open mana, or you chance the Browbeat into a potential (and highly likely) counter. Even if you do resolve it, your opponent will probably take the damage, draw up to five, and be ready to deal with the burn you throw at them next with whatever they've been developing over the past three turns. You don't want to give a control player too many options, control is all about creating a situation that favors them. You have to assume they will know the situation that best favors them and will twist it to their advantage given enough time. Browbeat will give them, if nothing else, time because of its sorcery speed awkwardness and relatively high cost for a burn spell. This is just one case where I'd much rather have a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flames of the Blood Hand\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Flames of the Blood Hand\">Flames of the Blood Hand</a>, a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma Jet\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Magma Jet\">Magma Jet</a>, or a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc Trail\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Arc Trail\">Arc Trail</a>. <br /><br />Example 2: You're playing against zoo with a fully developed board and it's turn 5. You have four mountains open. You're facing down ten power of creatures at less than ten life. They have four life. You topdeck a Browbeat, play it, and they let you draw three cards. You don't draw anything that can deal four damage for one mana. They proceed to kill you with their creatures and the burn in their hand. This is one case where you'd much rather have that four damage out of a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame Javelin\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Flame Javelin\">Flame Javelin</a>. <br /><br />I could give you more examples and more matchups, but these two examples highlight my main problems with the card. It's inflexible, it's awkward, and it always gives you what you want less. You have to assume your opponent is intelligent and knows what mode will benefit their deck more at the time you play it. I'd like to like Browbeat, it's a flavorful and interesting card, but ultimately it's not a particularly good one. If you want to play a &quot;punisher&quot; themed card in a burn, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing Devil\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vexing Devil\">Vexing Devil</a> is much better.

Browbeat will give them, if nothing else, time because of its sorcery speed awkwardness and relatively high cost for a burn spell. This is just one case where I'd much rather have a [autocard]Flames of the Blood Hand[/autocard], a [autocard]Magma Jet[/autocard], or a [autocard]Arc Trail[/autocard]. \n\nExample 2: You're playing against zoo with a fully developed board and it's turn 5. You have four mountains open. You're facing down ten power of creatures at less than ten life. They have four life. You topdeck a Browbeat, play it, and they let you draw three cards. You don't draw anything that can deal four damage for one mana. They proceed to kill you with their creatures and the burn in their hand. This is one case where you'd much rather have that four damage out of a [autocard]Flame Javelin[/autocard]. \n\nI could give you more examples and more matchups, but these two examples highlight my main problems with the card. It's inflexible, it's awkward, and it always gives you what you want less. You have to assume your opponent is intelligent and knows what mode will benefit their deck more at the time you play it. I'd like to like Browbeat, it's a flavorful and interesting card, but ultimately it's not a particularly good one. If you want to play a \"punisher\" themed card in a burn, [autocard]Vexing Devil[/autocard] is much better. ",

   "text_parsed": "A lot of these comments are calling Tibalt useless and only good because of his art. Well he costs 2 to bring out so you get to start using him right away and that's good at the beginning of battles. Especially when the deck he is made for has so many effects that can be used from the graveyard. Put him out on your second turn (and odds are your opponent(s) can't hit him for another turn or so) draw your card, and with most of your cards activating in the graveyard the random card you're sending there is probably cheaper and more useful there then in your hand. You get to pretty much replace the card you want in the grave with something that you may be able to use right then. And if you keep adding cards with effects such as &quot;deal # amount of damage to # amount of cards&quot; (for a basic example) then you can keep him protected by picking off anything that might hit him, and if not all of them you can a) kill some but not all, b) weaken a few, or c) kill some and weaken the ones attacking. With his reputation of being (quote) &quot;the weakest planes walker ever made&quot; (unquote) you may have several players overlooking him because they don't see him as a major threat, thus allowing you to store the damaging cards for when needed. The beauty of this planeswalker are his own weaknesses being able to make opponents (sometimes) overlook him, and if that doesn't work you can use his effect to quickly pay for cheap flashbacks. His -4 ability should really be saved for after using his -6. Because hitting someone with the -4 will alert them that though small he can have a nasty bite sort of speak. With the right hand (that isn't too hard to get) you can take your opponents creatures, attack him directly, or destroy some if not all of his creatures. Then destroy every remaining one so they have nothing. The most useful part that I can't seem to help but see as perhaps one of the most useful effects of all planes walkers is he's cheap, small enough to overlook (at least for a while) and can be a huge help with flashbacks and other like effects while storing damage cards in your hand. In a personal opinion his +1 effect is his greatest power of the three. His rival Sorin (the one from the duel decks) costs one black, one white, and two colorless. Not as quick to get out. Sure once he comes out you can have your emblems and vampires. But Tibalt can easily hit Sorin with two 3/1 creatures with haste and a flashback cost of 2. Meaning he can easily destroy Sorin the moment he comes out. Relying on the planeswalker to fight makes them more of a target as where Tibalt is not a fighter. He is made to help the cards in your deck, and he does that very well. For a fighting planeswalker Tibalt isn't tooth and claw and fighting with him is pointless and he is the worst in that way. But smashing apart the opponent with a cheap army, that's where he has other planeswalkers beat. In the future I can see Tibalt becoming the new Jace and quickly gaining new forms and powers matching his self defense fighting style making him potentially on of the best planeswalkers ever invented. All in all with Tibalt the action happens everywhere but the field, it happens where the opponents have the hardest times defending against.",

And, Chandra Nalar, don't even get me started. \n\nA 2 MANA PLANESWALKER. Please, this card must've been pushed. When my friend plays it as early as T2, I know I'm fucked. He draws 3 lightning bolts and flashbacks the cards he discards. So good in decks that abuse graveyard-returns. I usually have 6 or 5 cards in my hand by T4 playing my Lifegain Selesnya deck, easy 5-6 damage. Then he keeps bombarding me with burns.",

For two mana, there's just not much that they could do to help him suck less. In fact, Tibalt is probably best ignored to death, watching you pitch your best spells in exchange for lands, feeding him a bit of damage every now and again to keep him from his ultimate.",

If he lives the next turn, then I'll start making vampires. <br /><br />He's incredibly efficient and causes massive headaches for opponents.

   "text_posted": "I haven't played with many planeswalkers, but this is far and away my favorite one that I've played with. I run a more aggro version of Orzhov in standard (using cards like [autocard]Vampire Nighthawk[/autocard], [autocard]Frontline Medic[/autocard], etc.), and I usually just get the emblem out right from the moment I cast him and don't bother with the vampire token ability. If he lives the next turn, then I'll start making vampires. \n\nHe's incredibly efficient and causes massive headaches for opponents.
