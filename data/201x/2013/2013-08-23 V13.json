It's also interesting to note that Jace TMS is the only 4-mana planeswalker (arguably aside from <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon, Champion of Justice\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Gideon, Champion of Justice\">Gideon, Champion of Justice</a>) with a &quot;+2&quot; or higher ability, quickly getting out of range from burn and unblocked creatures straying in his direction.<br /><br />{2}) His +0 ability lets you <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Brainstorm\">Brainstorm</a> for free. Brainstorm is much more powerful than simply drawing a card, as you'll have much more control over what you want to draw and lets you dig a lot deeper for the cards that you need to gain the board advantage.<br /><br />{3}) His -1 ability (arguably the most versatile of the lot) lets you <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Unsummon\">Unsummon</a> a creature. This can help clear blockers, protect Jace (if the creature doesn't have haste), and completely eliminate the threat in case you have a counterspell or targeted hand disruption, such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Thoughtseize\">Thoughtseize</a>, at the ready. For extra value, this ability can also be used to return cards such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster Mage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Snapcaster Mage\">Snapcaster Mage</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion Clique\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vendilion Clique\">Vendilion Clique</a> (or even <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind Clique\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mistbind Clique\">Mistbind Clique</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter Sprite\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Spellstutter Sprite\">Spellstutter Sprite</a> if you're playing Faeries) to your hand to abuse their already powerful &quot;enter the battlefield&quot; abilities.<br /><br />{4}) Finally, his -12 ability, while expensive, is an automatic win in most situations unless your opponent has a very commanding board position. It's worth noting that Jace's ability targets <i>any</i> player, so you could potentially redirect it at the person controlling Jace... Or if you have a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory Maniac\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Laboratory Maniac\">Laboratory Maniac</a> out on the battlefield and no cards in hand, you could just exile your own library and win the next time you would draw a card.<br /><br />So as you can (hopefully) see, Jace is the sort of card that will win you the game in most cases if he reaches his ultimate, and all of his other abilities are either geared towards keeping your opponent on the back foot, abusing strong cards or helping you draw the cards you need in order to protect him.

You then take all the cards in your hand, shuffle them and put them on the table, and those cards are now your new library. If you have no cards in hand, your library is simply exiled (and you probably lose on your next turn because you can't draw a card). This is why Jace's -12 is seen as an auto-win: If you weren't about to win the game then and there, your chances of ever doing so just vanished into thin air.",

Unlike [autocard]Jitte[/autocard], there isn't a realistic idea that secondary value of the card holds back its reprint...\n\n\nBut....somehow, I'm trying to imagine a Modern Card Frame Psychatog....and his Toothy Evil Grin, His Crocodile Smile, is TOO MUCH a part of his image. Commission New Artwork? ala Tarmogoyf? \nOne could argue that it just stops being Psychatog. \n\n\nNow, Wizards being a Business, and Businesses existing to make money, I have every confidence they will reprint Psychatog, maybe even soon. He's just one their Iconic Faces, not the level of [autocard]Jace[/autocard] or [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard] or [autocard]Hurloon Minotaur[/autocard], but I think he IS as famous for that ugly mug as [autocard]Arcbound Ravager[/autocard] is, or the general look of [autocard]Faeries[/autocard] in Lorwyn.\n\n\nFor now, I just don't think [autocard]Psychatog[/autocard]'s face quite belongs on the MODERN card frame....but I do want one. :3 Wizards is unlikely to think he's cool enough for a Judge Foil. Oh well. [autocard]Chainer's Edict[/autocard], with this frame and this art, DOES fit Modern Magic just a little better than a Psychatog does.\n\nThat's what I'm telling myself to get to sleep at night because they didn't put Psychatog in here when they ABSOLUTELY SHOULD HAVE. :/\n\nThey should have DARED to include a mix of Modern and Pre-Modern card frames. o.O \n\nOr printed Jace and co. in Pre-Modern Card Frames. o.o",

THAT right there <- <- <- Is what the Vault should be about! Showcasing CLASSIC cards to people who DON'T know about them yet. \n\nI do think I like this card. I am not positive if The Vault is the best place for it...I kind of think Duel Decks would be just fine. :P  But, I guess the Vault EVENTUALLY needed a Mana Elf? Might as well sooner than later. :P \n\n\nI'm already psyched for next year's Vault. :) And I hope we get a Modern Frame of old Fyndhorn art soon?\n\nExplanation: I clicked the other links for this card in Gatherer. That is how I discovered the Ice Age art and determined I liked it better. :) Feels more Old School/D&D. Or more Urza's Era? Fyndhorn Elves should have got reprinted in Invasion block, but I bet there's an explanation for why that doesn't make sense in the novels of Jeff Grubb.

   "text_parsed": "It's legitimate to judge a card by many criterion, not just one. <br /><br />For Timmy, Spike, and Johnny, it's OK to say &quot;this card is for you/this card is NOT for you&quot;<br /><br />For the Color Wheel, it's ok to argue *what* belongs in what color, or what colors could use a change, a New Thing, but it's NOT okay to say &quot;yeah but the Color Pie just doesn't matter this time.&quot;<br /><br />For the Melvin-Vorthos issues, it's NOT ok, in my opinion, to say that it's alright for a card to be &quot;Not for Vorthos&quot;, OR &quot;Not for Melvin&quot;, because every Jank Limited Playable Common proves that you can design, literally, thousands of cards of any kind you want that please The Color Wheel, Vorthos and Melvin all at the same time, irregardless of whether the card is &quot;Also a Timmy card&quot;, &quot;Also a Johnny card&quot;, or &quot;Also a Spike card&quot;<br /><br />This card to me immediately hits Timmy nicely- it's a Green fatty, and TimmyForever *really* hates Blue and Black, so Protection from the Horribly Unfun <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Counterspell\">Counterspell</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom Blade\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Doom Blade\">Doom Blade</a> colors is always nice. :)<br /><br />For Johnny, there's admittedly a lot of &quot;AHA!&quot; moments you can have <i>just</i> from the Changeling keyword and the Shapeshifter type, not to mention that it's got a Doubling Ability, and we all know Johnny likes <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Doubling\">Doubling</a>. <br /><br />For Spike, he *loves* that this is a 4/4 for four mana with pseudo Evasion *and* is harder to Remove.<br />(Protection can be used offensively and defensively- unblockable as well as untargetable! sorry for the &quot;<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duh\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Duh\">Duh</a>&quot; moment xP )<br /><br />So Johnny, Spike, and Timmy all like this card. Well- why isn't it PERFECT for the Vault then? <br />I don't know what Melvin thinks of it in the context of <i>Lorwyn</i> Block, but in the context of this commemorative Box, Melvin appreciates it was a high-impact Tournament Staple.<br /><br />Here is the Thing: <br /><br />Look at <i>Limited Edition: Alpha</i>. I would be fairly unsurprised if Spike and Johnny couldn't find ten whole cards they liked in the whole set. That set is FULL TO THE BRIM of cards for Melvin and Vorthos and Timmy though. Vorthos pretty much loves every card in Alpha. <br /><br />Spike DOES love the Power, a little *too much*...but there aren't many of them, and they're all Blue, Black, or Artifact (extend your definition of &quot;Power&quot; here). and anyway the problem is that Spike and Melvin are at complete odds over <i>Alpha</i>, when *normally* Melvin and Spike tend to agree on things, and Timmy and Vorthos tend to agree to disagree with Melvin and Spike. Spike might even be able to find a handful of cards in other colors he likes, but.....in a 295 card set, Spike *really does* have trouble composing a &quot;Top 10 Green&quot; or &quot;Top 10 White&quot; cards. That's a huge problem.<br /><br />Vorthos is divided into two camps over the Changeling type: Those who say &quot;That is the flavor of Lorwyn&quot; and those who say &quot;That is Not the flavor of Magic as a whole&quot;. <br /><br />It's ok for Magic to redefine itself, but just how okay is it to stray from the Core? From Alpha? At what point do you say &quot;we can keep making this changing, evolving, game, but we need to change the name too, and this is no longer Magic, and it will not keep the next name we pick either.&quot;<br /><br />Vorthos asks questions like this, and some Vorthoses disagree with the Changeling Mechanic. Because it's more important for cards to be &quot;For Vorthos And for Melvin&quot; than it is for them to be &quot;For Johnny, For Timmy, or For Spike&quot;, then this card's &quot;Vaultability&quot; is questionable.",
   "text_posted": "It's legitimate to judge a card by many criterion, not just one. \n\nFor Timmy, Spike, and Johnny, it's OK to say \"this card is for you/this card is NOT for you\"\n\nFor the Color Wheel, it's ok to argue *what* belongs in what color, or what colors could use a change, a New Thing, but it's NOT okay to say \"yeah but the Color Pie just doesn't matter this time.\"\n\nFor the Melvin-Vorthos issues, it's NOT ok, in my opinion, to say that it's alright for a card to be \"Not for Vorthos\", OR \"Not for Melvin\", because every Jank Limited Playable Common proves that you can design, literally, thousands of cards of any kind you want that please The Color Wheel, Vorthos and Melvin all at the same time, irregardless of whether the card is \"Also a Timmy card\", \"Also a Johnny card\", or \"Also a Spike card\"\n\nThis card to me immediately hits Timmy nicely- it's a Green fatty, and TimmyForever *really* hates Blue and Black, so Protection from the Horribly Unfun [autocard]Counterspell[/autocard] or [autocard]Doom Blade[/autocard] colors is always nice. :)\n\nFor Johnny, there's admittedly a lot of \"AHA!\" moments you can have [i]just[/i] from the Changeling keyword and the Shapeshifter type, not to mention that it's got a Doubling Ability, and we all know Johnny likes [autocard]Doubling[/autocard]. \n\nFor Spike, he *loves* that this is a 4/4 for four mana with pseudo Evasion *and* is harder to Remove.\n(Protection can be used offensively and defensively- unblockable as well as untargetable! sorry for the \"[autocard]Duh[/autocard]\" moment xP )\n\nSo Johnny, Spike, and Timmy all like this card. Well- why isn't it PERFECT for the Vault then? \nI don't know what Melvin thinks of it in the context of [i]Lorwyn[/i] Block, but in the context of this commemorative Box, Melvin appreciates it was a high-impact Tournament Staple.\n\nHere is the Thing: \n\nLook at [i]Limited Edition: Alpha[/i]. I would be fairly unsurprised if Spike and Johnny couldn't find ten whole cards they liked in the whole set. That set is FULL TO THE BRIM of cards for Melvin and Vorthos and Timmy though. Vorthos pretty much loves every card in Alpha. \n\nSpike DOES love the Power, a little *too much*...but there aren't many of them, and they're all Blue, Black, or Artifact (extend your definition of \"Power\" here). and anyway the problem is that Spike and Melvin are at complete odds over [i]Alpha[/i], when *normally* Melvin and Spike tend to agree on things, and Timmy and Vorthos tend to agree to disagree with Melvin and Spike. Spike might even be able to find a handful of cards in other colors he likes, but.....in a 295 card set, Spike *really does* have trouble composing a \"Top 10 Green\" or \"Top 10 White\" cards. That's a huge problem.\n\nVorthos is divided into two camps over the Changeling type: Those who say \"That is the flavor of Lorwyn\" and those who say \"That is Not the flavor of Magic as a whole\". \n\nIt's ok for Magic to redefine itself, but just how okay is it to stray from the Core? From Alpha? At what point do you say \"we can keep making this changing, evolving, game, but we need to change the name too, and this is no longer Magic, and it will not keep the next name we pick either.\"\n\nVorthos asks questions like this, and some Vorthoses disagree with the Changeling Mechanic. Because it's more important for cards to be \"For Vorthos And for Melvin\" than it is for them to be \"For Johnny, For Timmy, or For Spike\", then this card's \"Vaultability\" is questionable.",

(As Vaults go, very inefficient to cast ([autocard]Balance[/autocard], Disk), though of course Cycling is very Valuable.) It's a more than fair card, and Vaults are just usually known for unfair cards. :)\n\nThis is a GOOD card. It just has...some amazing friends next to it in the box. o.O\n\nEDIT: I seem to have been massively downvoted. I guess I expected a 2.5-3.5 star rate for this comment. Let me clarify: IT IS A GREAT CARD. THE OTHER CARDS ARE JUST EVEN GREATER, and for what this does you can find LOTS of cheap-on-the-mana substitutes...EVEN though yes this is a great card, and say, in an Angely-THEMED deck I'd rather have this than [autocard]Nevinyrral's Disk[/autocard]? \n\nIt's versatile and shizz, and that's real cool, it is just that it is such a stapley thing, this was Onslaught Block's take on [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard], and every block has their own riff on that card, and like, a number of blocks' takes have been better, like [autocard]Final Judgment[/autocard] or [autocard]Supreme Verdict[/autocard]. I still give this card 4 stars minimum, I'd give six stars to Final Judgment though?",

   "text_parsed": "Dark ritual is kind of an overrated card. I mean in the right deck it is absolutely killer. It is iconic and has been in amazing plays since alpha. It enables potent vintage strategies with cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth's Will\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Yawgmoth's Will\">Yawgmoth's Will</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils of Agony\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Tendrils of Agony\">Tendrils of Agony</a>. So I will first say that this card is amazing, overpowered and part of devastating reanimation, recursion and storm strategies. Many a tournament has been won on its back.<br /><br />However, it is hardly an auto-include in all black decks. Most of what I see in gatherer comments are horrible strategies. The same is true for most times the card is linked from other gatherer pages. A lot of what I see are the kind of strategy that showed up pre-card advantage theory, or the kind of plays that are fun kitchen table stuff but not very good ideas. (Also, shame on you for playing 4 dark rituals in casual.) <br /><br />Firstly, chaining two dark ritual into a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian Obliterator\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Phyrexian Obliterator\">Phyrexian Obliterator</a> or similar is a horrible strategy. Every time we see a black bomb arrive, comments appear saying &quot;Turn one, Dark ritual, dark ritual, CARDNAME.&quot; Firstly, you only have about a 6% chance of opening with two or more rituals, so consistency? Out the door. Secondly, laying all your eggs in one basket is a dangerous game. Dark ritual often makes up for its card disadvantage, but only when you play it smart. Strategies like storm can do this because they are inherently resistant to anything your opponent tries to do against them. But just like strategies using auras to Voltron a killer creature, you are playing dangerous odds here.<br /><br />If I Dark ritual a Necropotence turn one (A solid use, but I cannot see necropotence getting you a turn one win given its drawback. Turn 2? sure.) and my opponent Pitches a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force of Will\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Force of Will\">Force of Will</a>, we are left even on card advantage. If You Dark Ritual + Dark Ritual to a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian Obliterator\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Phyrexian Obliterator\">Phyrexian Obliterator</a>, then I will <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=swords to plowshares\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"swords to plowshares\">swords to plowshares</a> it and you will concede.

I know someone is going to say my arguments go for black lotus too, that is true, but there are a few differences. 1: Black lotus is way better. I mean, it costs <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=0&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"0\" align=\"absbottom\" />! The power level is deafening. 2: Black lotus is easier to recur as a artifact. 3: Your strategy still shouldn't rely on having black lotus out. It goes in every deck, but your deck needs to stand without it. Most strategies I see for Dark ritual do not stand without the ritual. Literally all they are is powering out a big card an hoping your opponent doesn't answer. That strategy is too small minded to fly.<br /><br />EDIT: Dark ritual into duress/hymn is potent, versatile and hard to answer. A good example of a nice, non-risky, consistent use for the ritual.",
