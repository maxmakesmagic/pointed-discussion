Nowadays, simply having a first name and a last name and supertype &quot;Legendary&quot; doesn't seem like enough flavor for cards, which is sort of sad, but y'know, on the cards where that DOES work, I love it. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gosta Dirk\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Gosta Dirk\">Gosta Dirk</a>, anyone? I think part of the problem with Emmara on the <i>&quot;Legends&quot;</i> argument, though....is that she's Selesnya. <br /><br />She's no Viking, she's not a Barbarian, or a Warlord, or a Soldier, or any kind of class that you could make her look like a properly interesting DnD-character.  So simply appealing Only to <i>Legends</i> fans is not yet enough. The flavor text here is Good Enough if you want to go that route, but the art doesn't look Actiony enough or Regal enough. It looks quite abit like any old Citizen of Selesnya, like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage\">Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage</a>. But let's SAY you were trying to create a Legends-feeling card, because you thought that would be a great way to capture &quot;Reversing Power Creep&quot; in a jar, and that is honestly something you need to be looking for ways and opportunities to be doing. Let us pretend for the sake of argument that <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barktooth Warbeard\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Barktooth Warbeard\">Barktooth Warbeard</a> deserves 4/5 stars for being &quot;good <i>Legends</i> thinking&quot;. In that world, Emmara deserves 3 stars, I think. Which is just enough to not hate that she got printed. Barely.<br /><br />I, for one, am at least Very Glad that she doesn't have a 187 ability. I thought they were cute when I started playing (Lorwyn), I began to see that some of them were really good around Zendikar, and by Innistrad they started taking over Decklists. I think they have so much steam now that even White-Blue control is going to have to ALWAYS be building around 187s, and I don't like that.<br /><br />My last comment is that as I was reading <u>Agents of Artifice</u> and <u>The Secretist</u>, when it was announced that Emmara was going to be the Maze Runner, I expected either Spike or Vorthos to not like her card. FRANKLY- she's a weak character! I mean she's interesting to read about, but she's no leader! She's NOT powerful! It makes very little sense for her to be chosen as Maze Runner! The only things she has going for her is that she's a Healer, and she's Old. Every Elf Ever can say that about themselves. I don't know WHAT Trostani was thinking. She retired from Selesnya and befriended Jace, whom she doesn't know is a Planeswalker, but really, she sees very little action. So, this card is ACCURATE per my perception of Emmara's abilities as shown in the novel. Maybe she could have a little bit more life gain in here, but lifegain is weak and Selesnya has too many cards that populate for the mechanic to be here and be interesting and be remotely balanced (look at <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vorel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vorel\">Vorel</a>. Doesn't quite have Evolve, but he's pushing pretty hard how much you can do. Yes <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilder Bairn\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Gilder Bairn\">Gilder Bairn</a> and Doubling Season were better, but I think this just means Bairn should be a Rare, and Vorel is perfectly respectable in his Guild.)<br /><br />If Dragon's Maze is the <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> set, then Emmara Tandris is Fleur Delacour. Who pretty much totally sucked at the Tournament Tasks, was never on the frontlines of the Order of the Pheonix, but hey, that's war-level stuff, and for most every-day uses of Magic she was competent. By the way- it's not directly ripping off HP. MTG and HP are both ripping off a super-common generally good Adventure Idea. Find the Lost Thingy in the Place of Perils. It's Magic and Shiny and it's Really Cool. There are a lot of people looking for it. If they're ripping off anyone, they might be ripping off Indiana Jones, but I wasn't aware George Lucas ever did anything original.",

I think the intention of the card is that while a creature is attacking, it gets +1/+0, but that it would lose that bonus when the creature is no longer attacking.

So, which is correct?  I expected there to be a ruling on the Oracle text, but there doesn't appear to be one.

This should be obvious if you're aggro or midrange, but if you're control, you should prioritize making your own Aetherling or [autocard]Jace, Memory Adept[/autocard] and delay theirs with your Azorius Charm or whatnot. In really late game or in specific decks, you may be able to gain so much life that the 8 damage a turn doesn't kill you, such as from [autocard]Sphinx's Revelation[/autocard].\n\nIn most common situations, Aetherling represents the ultimate inevitability, which means he is the best way to say \"I have the long game. Win fast or you won't win.\"",

This deck can easily spawn an army of spirit tokens so if you use removal spells like Putrefy to kill of your opponents fliers and you have at least ten tokens on the field (which will not take long) then play a profit/loss to give them all +1/+1 then that's twenty damage and depending on your opponents life can be a game winner. This deck can spawn that many tokens by about turn 6 at the earliest proved you get the perfect starting hand.",

Your opponent is more likely to have a 2-drop, but again, if they don't this still gets in for 3, even when you're on the draw. Both tend to trade quickly because the non-aggressive deck will always block against the aggressive deck. The deathraiders do some of the same things, but the chance that they'll get in for the full damage is much lower. On average, with this card you get 3 damage and trades with one of their creatures. with the raiders, you probably get 1-2 damage and trades with a creature, but one turn later. That said, raiders are a slightly better lategame draw I guess, as long as your opponent plays around you having a possible haster.<br /><br />Overall, this card gets 3.5/5 from me. In the limited format, they are not great since the mana cost makes them nearly impossible to get out on t2 with the normal 3-color pile you end up with in DGR drafts. They normally get in some damage, but are nowhere near as overwhelming as clearly powerful cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin Guide\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Goblin Guide\">Goblin Guide</a>. And the most aggressive deck, monored, can't really afford to splash for them :(<br /><br />However, I will not deny the great feeling you get when you drop these t2 on the play and your opponent doesn't have a creature out.

(figured it mattered on this page too, since it's mentioned all over the Sphinx's actual discussion page.<br /><br />Overall, this card is a golden god.

This guy even shows up aggro monsters like [autocard]Blood Scrivener[/autocard] and [autocard]Sign in Blood[/autocard].\n\nThe flash keyword is important, the combo with [autocard]Whispering Madness[/autocard] is golden and the potential for another self-mill combo(FINALLY!!!) make this card an easy 5/5 for me. Beautiful.",

Red and Black have more than enough ways of finishing off players.  It does not matter how much life your opponents have.",

And fortunately, he also is in the color of burn, so that last point of damage - well that can come from Lightning Bolt, Shock, Searing Spear, Blightning, whatever tickles your fancy.<br /><br />However, all 3 abilities spell legitimate bomb for limited. Deathtouch and first strike means that he is going to make blocking him difficult, and probably gain incremental card advantage. And on defense you're going to have the control, so he's a star. Madcap Skills is on color and turns him from pretty good into devastation on offense. If you somehow get him through unblocked - give him evasion, kill your opponent's creatures, whatever - setting your opponent down to 1 from whatever position they were in is just deadly, and puts many a board position into a potential alpha strike position.<br /><br />The worst part about the card is that he can't contribute to the alpha strike. I had a situation in casual where I had my opponent on 1 thanks to his triggered ability, my opponent had 2 creatures to block with, and I had 4 that I could attack with... except 2 of them were Masters of Cruelties. So despite my dominant board state (though I was also on 1 life), I had to draw into either enough creatures to get one more than him so I could alpha, or a burn spell. Fortunately, I drew a creature before he drew anything useful, and my first MoC match was successful. :-)",

You can even play it with [autocard]Voice of Resurgence[/autocard] so even if you have to sacrifice you still get some value out of it, though playing this against the same card is pretty bad.",

Then you bring in *another* Progenitor Mimic, and copy the first one.  Now you've got a Progenitor Mimic on the battlefield with &quot;At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn't a token, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of this creature.&quot;<br /><br />So every turn, you get another Progenitor Mimic, which you can use to copy any other creature.  Basically, the benefit is this:  With one Progenitor Mimic, you could copy whatever creature you want and it would just keep copying that creature.  With two the normal way, you could copy the copy, and get three copies each turn of whatever creature you selected with the first one, or you could get one of the first one, and one of a different one but the same two each turn.  Either way, you're limited to just getting copies of the creatures you selected when they first came onto the battlefield.  But with THIS method, you can get a copy of whatever creature you want every turn.  Say your enemy just brought out a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul, the Aeons Torn\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Emrakul, the Aeons Torn\">Emrakul, the Aeons Torn</a>, well on your next turn you get one too!  And in two turns, you'll have TWO Emrakul's.  Talk about a backfire for your opponent.<br /><br />But, can anyone explain what happens if you use Progenitor Mimic to copy a land card that has been turned into a creature, such as with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydroform\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Hydroform\">Hydroform</a>?<br /><br />Since the rulings for Progenitor Mimic say:<br /><br />&quot;Progenitor Mimic copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token). It doesn’t copy ... any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.&quot;<br /><br />So what does that mean, exactly?  My card was printed as a land, not as a creature.  But it is a creature until the end of turn, due to a non-copy effect that changed its types.  So does that mean that when I copy it, it copies as a Land, not as a Land Creature?  And if that's the case, then what happens with the rules text on the copy: &quot;At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature isn't a token, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of this creature.&quot; ... Would the fact that &quot;this&quot; is not a creature cause it to be countered, the way invalid targets counters a spell?  In which case, would the mimic just die and go to the graveyard?  Or would it be fine, but the copy wouldn't create tokens?  Or would it just act completely as normal?<br /><br />Do we need an official ruling?  What does everybody else think/",

In short: Cycling is very good. You WANT Cycling Mana Stones. You MIGHT want Man-land Mana Stones. It's just that they are stealing each other's thunder at the moment. I am OK with the Short-Term awkwardness in exchange for being quite happy having any of the twenty cards from the cycles a couple years from now as 'quite serviceable' for Casual Mana Fixing in a wide range of decks that want the Utility. No, they're not as good AT ALL as the Signets, so Commander is going to have a bit of a hard time 'seeing the point', but in Really Casual, they make a Very Sad Deck a lot less sad, and you can teach a new player why these kinds of cards are good by putting them in a weak deck and letting them see that they are one of the best cards in their weak deck.

   "text_posted": "I don't know-- I like these at 3 CMC, I just admit it's awkward to have them in the same block as the Keyrunes- but later on, when we start seeing both Cycles reprinted a fair bit, we'll appreciate them more as being like Xth Edition Man-Lands (not the greatest man-lands ever, but man-lands are man-lands/man-artifacts are man-artifacts) and like the Cycling non-Basic Lands that manage to get into every. single. preconstructed. product. ever. In short: Cycling is very good. You WANT Cycling Mana Stones. You MIGHT want Man-land Mana Stones. It's just that they are stealing each other's thunder at the moment. I am OK with the Short-Term awkwardness in exchange for being quite happy having any of the twenty cards from the cycles a couple years from now as 'quite serviceable' for Casual Mana Fixing in a wide range of decks that want the Utility.

   "text_parsed": "Ok, let's analyze for a second:<br /><br />Mana cost: 4, perfectly playable for a walker. Only requires a single U and R, so not too color dependent.<br />Colors: red and blue. A decent control pair. Nothing wrong with that.<br />+1: This one's a bit tricky. Because that tap doesn't come with a &quot;it doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step&quot; (which would've made the card too powerful), it means that it can't be used as pseudo-removal. For the most part, it's going to be used to either eliminate a potential blocker, or to tap down a land or other permanent immediately, so that if the opponent wants to use that permanent they have to do so then and there. So it can put timing in your favor. The untap, however, is a lot more potent. At worst, it untaps a land so you can either accelerate with it (playing a 6 drop the turn after Ral comes out), or to have mana open for counterspells or other instants. So ultimately, it's a decent +1, but keep in mind it won't protect Ral all on its lonesome - it needs other cards to help out. In standard, be wary about playing it as soon as you hit 4 mana - there's not a lot of 1 drop removal that can take care of *any* threat the opponent might play.<br />-2: Absolutely sexy, and a perfectly acceptable first-off activation. Lightning Bolt - that's all there is to it. And it can hit most turn 4 or 5 creatures, meaning that his minus can actually protect him until you untap in a lot of cases.<br />-7: Of course, if you activate this you're already doing quite well at controlling the game. It's luck based, and occasionally you might get only 1 or 0 turns out of this (I've actually tested this guy out, and the one guy I got ultimate, I kid you not, I got 5 tails and no extra turns -.-), but if you get at least one turn he cycles himself, and any more just puts you in a tremendous power position (unless you're in topdeck mode at that point). This isn't nearly as game ending as a lot of other walkers, but it's still quite potent.<br /><br />So ultimately, in more serious decks Ral is going to be included to make a lot of use out of his +1 and -2 abilities, with his ultimate as a sexy afterthought. Which is exactly how a walker should be. He has some standard potential given his mana cost and repeatable lightning bolt, and just imagine this scenario in a Team America deck: turn 3, Geist of St Traft. Turn 4, Ral, either tapping down their best/only Geist blocker, or outright Bolting it to smithereens. Lather, rinse, repeat. That's sexy right there.",

A decent control pair. Nothing wrong with that.\n+1: This one's a bit tricky. Because that tap doesn't come with a \"it doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step\" (which would've made the card too powerful), it means that it can't be used as pseudo-removal. For the most part, it's going to be used to either eliminate a potential blocker, or to tap down a land or other permanent immediately, so that if the opponent wants to use that permanent they have to do so then and there. So it can put timing in your favor. The untap, however, is a lot more potent. At worst, it untaps a land so you can either accelerate with it (playing a 6 drop the turn after Ral comes out), or to have mana open for counterspells or other instants. So ultimately, it's a decent +1, but keep in mind it won't protect Ral all on its lonesome - it needs other cards to help out. In standard, be wary about playing it as soon as you hit 4 mana - there's not a lot of 1 drop removal that can take care of *any* threat the opponent might play.\n-2: Absolutely sexy, and a perfectly acceptable first-off activation. Lightning Bolt - that's all there is to it. And it can hit most turn 4 or 5 creatures, meaning that his minus can actually protect him until you untap in a lot of cases.\n-7: Of course, if you activate this you're already doing quite well at controlling the game. It's luck based, and occasionally you might get only 1 or 0 turns out of this (I've actually tested this guy out, and the one guy I got ultimate, I kid you not, I got 5 tails and no extra turns -.-), but if you get at least one turn he cycles himself, and any more just puts you in a tremendous power position (unless you're in topdeck mode at that point). This isn't nearly as game ending as a lot of other walkers, but it's still quite potent.\n\nSo ultimately, in more serious decks Ral is going to be included to make a lot of use out of his +1 and -2 abilities, with his ultimate as a sexy afterthought. Which is exactly how a walker should be. He has some standard potential given his mana cost and repeatable lightning bolt, and just imagine this scenario in a Team America deck: turn 3, Geist of St Traft. Turn 4, Ral, either tapping down their best/only Geist blocker, or outright Bolting it to smithereens. Lather, rinse, repeat. That's sexy right there.",

(3/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 9/1024.\n\nNow let's make it easy by combining the two!\n(5 C 2) * (3/4) ^ 2 * (1/4) ^ 3 = (ways to get it) (probability of getting it) = 9/1024\n\nAnd now in terms of a well known equation:\nn C k * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)\nWhere:\nn is the amount of flips or trials\nk is the amount of successes\np is the probability of a success\n1 - p = the probability of a failure\nn - k is the number of failures\n\nI won't continue with all the numbers, but you should be able to calculate it yourself now!",

Sadly I think he is half built for control and half for aggro (+1 is aggro focused, -2 is control, ultimate is a win button) and I don't see any deck archtypes that can run him at a competitive level right now.

After it is no longer so good at winning games as whatever comes in the future, it will be pretty much a [autocard]Craw Wurm[/autocard], except not as cool as Craw Wurm because Craw is way way older. \n\nTo amend this, the flavor text should have supported believing that Mat'Selesnya really has a special love of Wurms as its Beatstick of Choice, which would have matched our expectations after [autocard]Armada Wurm[/autocard]. This current flavor text makes me think that any old Simic Monster would have been just fine to use, that it's not all that important that it's a Wurm, meaning it's really pretty hard to care about these Ravnica Wurms in a long-term way. :P \n\nThey're Spike-Timmies, like Baneslayer. Baneslayer is going to suffer the same fate to Power Creep, whereas Serra Angel and Akroma will not, just like Craw Wurm will actually outlive this in the minds of nostalgics. :P \"If you're gonna use old bad cards, might as well use the worst oldest ones ever that used to honest-to-god make people happy to pull. Magic was a different game back then.\" Not that Akroma is ever likely to really be called bad. Just saying that even if something better than Akroma gets made, she will stick out in the history books entirely based on that Creature Type line, rules text quality or not-- Legendary. Angel. with a block based on her story. She's HISTORY, whereas Baneslayer is depending on being considered Spikey for people to care about her.\n\n[autocard]Deathrite Shaman[/autocard] is an Outstanding Example of a Spike card that is also Vorthos enough to always be Cool, whether it's any good in the Future or not.",

The rarest card in the set and the power to control Ravnica is just given to everyone who showed up trying to search for it in the name of their guild... Doesn't that kill the point of searching for it? For buying packs to get the secret of Ravnica? Now that I got 4 foil Maze's End because nobody wanted theirs and as a Guildgate/Shockland collector me pulling this card will just be a wasted land slot in the pack.\n\nTerrible card, terrible build-up, terrible distribution.

These are Not quite even Champions. These aren't, in every single case, the Guildmaster's Favored and Beloved Right Hands. These aren't the Darth Vaders to the Emperors. Their kinda more like Rogue Desperate Last Minute Heroes. Sometimes they're already well-known and established in the Guild, but actually, in the vast majority of cases, they're people who are sort-of borderline in their Guild and the Guild decides: &quot;Here is your chance to be our Hero, plus if you fail we are willing to risk your death.&quot;<br /><br />Massacre Girl is a crazy Zealot of the Guild that Rakdos sort of favors, but everyone is Expendable in Rakdos anyway. <br /><br />Melek was Invented on the spot for the Maze Running, meaning neither <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Niv-Mizzet\">Niv-Mizzet</a> nor <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ral Zarek\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ral Zarek\">Ral Zarek</a> felt like risking Ral Zarek.<br /><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emmara Tandris\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Emmara Tandris\">Emmara Tandris</a> is kind of a servant of Trostrani, but her Boyfriend is actually secretly one of the many disguises of Darth <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lazav\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lazav\">Lazav</a>.<br /><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirko Vosk\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mirko Vosk\">Mirko Vosk</a> is totally Captain Needa of the Dimir. He's been given important assignments, but he has Screwed UP. Big Time.

The way I would play this, would be to cast <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter Games\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Slaughter Games\">Slaughter Games</a> first on turn 4 if possible, and get rid of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx's Revelation\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sphinx's Revelation\">Sphinx's Revelation</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme Verdict\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Supreme Verdict\">Supreme Verdict</a>.

If they counter, then that is okay, since it is one counter less when it is time to cast Sire. When the way is clear, I'll play anything else I can from my hand first, and then play this guy.

Sire will not stay on the board long during late-game against a control deck, if he even makes it to the table at all. Slaughter Games will be this guy's wingman, use it to remove threats (verdict, revelation, breath, dissolve, syncopate) or if you are feeling lucky, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth, Sun's Champion\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Elspeth, Sun's Champion\">Elspeth, Sun's Champion</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace, Architect of Thought\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jace, Architect of Thought\">Jace, Architect of Thought</a>.

Pretty good. Curves into [autocard]Borborygmos Enraged[/autocard]. Cast [autocard]Maze Behemoth[/autocard] the next turn and prepare to just own.\n\nIzzet: Not the best choice. No creatures that really need haste. [autocard]Tenement Crasher[/autocard] has haste already, but [autocard]Cobblebrute[/autocard] may need it. Either way, with six mana, you could do a lot more damage in burn.\n\nRakdos: It's nice, but I think a lot more people will like [autocard]Exava, Rakdos Blood Witch[/autocard].

I was playing green aggro last SGO and went 7-3, two of the matchs I lost were very close -- except the last match against UWR control, which I felt was completely hopeless. Game 2 he went T2 [autocard]Augur of Bolas[/autocard] revealing Warleader's Helix, T3 [autocard]Pillar of Flame[/autocard] + Augur of Bolas revealing [autocard]Supreme Verdict[/autocard], and T4 [autocard]Restoration Angel[/autocard] revealing another Warleader's Helix. Normally an aggro deck can try to finish off opponents at 6-10 life via burn and hasty creatures for a few turns after T4-5. Add just one Helix, though, the game is likely lost right there when the last creature is killed.",
