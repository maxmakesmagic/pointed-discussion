Do they block, if they do will they lose their guy, if they don't how much damage will they take... Most pump guys, it's pretty obvious how it can and will be pumped in each scenario. These guys are so shifty... And they make the most out of pump spells too. Sweet card. [autocard]Kiln Fiend[/autocard] is awesome too, but evasion makes this one have so much more potential.",

A spell cast through Isochron Scepter (or, for that matter, through Cipher itself) is not a card, so you cannot Cipher it.<br /><br />@HoboColin: &quot;Alternative cost&quot; means something like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force of Will\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Force of Will\">Force of Will</a> where you do something else instead of pay its usual cost. You can't do that with scepter. &quot;Additional cost&quot; is something like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fling\">Fling</a> where you have to do something else in addition to its usual cost. You CAN put Fling on this but you'd have to sac a creature every time you use it. Kicker is an optional additional cost. You are never forced to pay the Kicker, but you have the option to. If you choose to Kick the spell then you have to pay the kicker cost.<br /><br />@Tower_Mazer: First, you can't use Fuse with Isochron Scepter. Fuse is an alternative cost, like buyback. Second, in every case where you imprint a split card onto Scepter, you may only cast one side of it. The imprint ability calls for an &quot;instant card with CMC 2 or less.&quot; The way mana cost works with split cards is tricky - technically speaking, the CMC of Far/Away is 2 and 3 at the same time (not 5). Therefore, it meets the criteria for imprint. The activated ability of Scepter always costs {2}, regardless of the CMC of the card you are casting. The activated ability of Scepter doesn't check the CMC of the spell you are casting, so you are indeed free to cast Away off the Scepter for {2}.<br /><br />@Everyone suggesting sorceries for use with Isochron Scepter: It works with instants only.",
   "text_posted": "@Toquinha1977: You can only Cipher the spell card itself, not a copy, as the rules for Cipher specifically state that you may exile \"this spell card\". A spell cast through Isochron Scepter (or, for that matter, through Cipher itself) is not a card, so you cannot Cipher it.\n\n@HoboColin: \"Alternative cost\" means something like [autocard]Force of Will[/autocard] where you do something else instead of pay its usual cost. You can't do that with scepter. \"Additional cost\" is something like [autocard]Fling[/autocard] where you have to do something else in addition to its usual cost.

In this sense sometimes its better to maindeck [autocard]deadly recluse[/autocard] to fill this role. \n\nHes just sticking up your hand and leaving you to guess if they have a flyer or not. If they do and you drop it too early, then they get out their big flyer. If they don't then hes just waiting for no reason.\n\nStill, this does make a nice sideboard card.",

   "text_parsed": "I didn't like the overload cost on this card when I first saw it. It was one of the first cards spoiled for Return to Ravnica, and I looked on this card (and the overload mechanic) with disdain. I labeled the card as pack-filler at best, and the overload mechanic as <i>Kicker</i> with a new name.<br /><br />Then I, in tandem with my friend, purchased the Izzet vs Golgari duel decks the day after their release. <br /><br />After a few uses of the card, I came to love running into it. At instant speed, this card is ready to hit the table any time you need it to, which is a huge advantage. I was already aware that you didn't <i>have </i>to pay the overload cost. However, it was the mechanic that made this card different from <i>Heat Ray</i>, which made me want more from it.<br /><br />I realized that it was actually better than Heat Ray in almost every case, which is a card I never complained about (I actually drafted it as often as I could). Then, after warring with the Golgari swarm, I saw the appeal of the overload cost. It's meant to deal with token swarm, not bigger creatures!

   "text_posted": "I didn't like the overload cost on this card when I first saw it. It was one of the first cards spoiled for Return to Ravnica, and I looked on this card (and the overload mechanic) with disdain. I labeled the card as pack-filler at best, and the overload mechanic as [i]Kicker[/i] with a new name.\n\nThen I, in tandem with my friend, purchased the Izzet vs Golgari duel decks the day after their release. \n\nAfter a few uses of the card, I came to love running into it. At instant speed, this card is ready to hit the table any time you need it to, which is a huge advantage. I was already aware that you didn't [i]have [/i]to pay the overload cost. However, it was the mechanic that made this card different from [i]Heat Ray[/i], which made me want more from it.\n\nI realized that it was actually better than Heat Ray in almost every case, which is a card I never complained about (I actually drafted it as often as I could).
