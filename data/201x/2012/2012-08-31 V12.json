It's just a 1/1 flier, so in theory there are many things you should be able to do about it- a good sized blocker with vigilance is my first thought- but this land does present you with a puzzle that you can't just ignore- you have to solve it- even though it's easy enough to solve, it's something that does insist you actually solve it, rather than just skip it and figure it won't hurt too much- a 1/1 flier a turn is what Bitterblossom is, so consider this like casting a Bitterblossom for your opponent- can you beat Bitterblossom? If you can, all good. If you can't, make your deck better til it can. ",

The reason it was selected to be reprinted in FtV:R is because of its widespread use in the dredge archetype that attempts to mill itself out and then flash back [autocard]Dread Return[/autocard] on something huge that wins the game immediately. It sees regular legacy play and even vintage play--it's pretty much a one-use, non-restricted [autocard]Bazaar of Baghdad[/autocard], and the Bazaar is easily one of the most powerful lands in the game, which means this card ranks right up there, too.",

   "text_posted": "@JL2736:\nThere is one problem with Unstable Frontier: you will be wulnerable to instant-speed burn spells during your own turn. The same is true for sacrificing this to Zuran Orb instead of paynig upkeep and then playing it again via Crucible of Worlds.\n\nI would suggest to just pay the upkeep once, then on you main phase play another Chasm, sacrifing the previous one as its enter the battlefiel ability triggers. Now the cumulative upkeep is reset. Then use Crucible of Worlds to repeat this on following turns. Sure, you will not be able to play more lands without something like Fastbond and will pay 2 life each turn, but the protection against damage is never off and you only need 3 cards for the combo.",
