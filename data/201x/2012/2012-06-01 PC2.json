   "text_posted": "very powerful general in EDH. In a properly designed deck, you will usually be happy with whatever you cascade into, be it a 1 mana [autocard]sol ring[/autocard] or your 6 mana [autocard]consecrated sphinx[/autocard]. You then get a creature that kills in 3 hits and that's if it's just killing from general damage, since mass haste means you can easily win with just mass creatures. Find ways to willingly sacrifice wanderer or bounce it to your hand (ex; [autocard]food chain[/autocard], [autocard]crystal shard[/autocard]) to get the cascade triggers again, and you will win with sheer card advantage.\n\nIt's not a tier 1 general in 1v1 EDH, because the randomness of cascade does affect the consistency of the deck. But it's definitely a deck to be wary of, particularly if you do hit good cascades.",

   "text_posted": "@VonDread - it's not rated higher because it's a 1/1 unless you give yourself card disadvantage. It's why most devour cards are underwhelming - because to actually get their upside, you need to invest into some card disadvantage. Admittedly, some of the better ones more than pay you back for it if they're allowed to live, like Mycoloth or Voracious Dragon, but this guy is just a vanilla creature that can get removed in a plethora of ways, leaving you at least 2 creatures down (this guy plus the one/s he ate).\n\nIf he lives though, and is allowed to connect, then sure, a 4/4+ for 3 is always going to be good. Most better decks would rather just play unconditionally good creatures though. ;-)",

   "text_posted": "Guys, the reason people feared and loved this card was that it sat at a convenient middle point to be cascaded into and to cascade into other things. There's a lot of 5 CMC cascade spells that would have their effect, flow into this, and this in turn would go into something else. For example, [autocard]Bituminous Blast[/autocard], [autocard]Bloodbraid Elf[/autocard], [autocard]Blightning[/autocard]. For 5 mana you just did 8 damage to your opponent, dropped a creature with haste onto the field, and had them discard two cards.\n\nYou're not just getting a 3/2 with haste for 4 mana - lands don't count for cascade so basically you'd be getting a 3/2 with haste and some other card that could be awesome - from a creature to a buff to a burn.",
