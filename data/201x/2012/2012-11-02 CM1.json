And that, is awesome.\n\nSince Abundance replaces the draw, and you didn't 'draw' those two cards, there's no reason for you to carry on with the rest of the card's abilities.  The last (on 9/16/2007) card ruling speaks to it: \"If you choose to draw two cards, then replace one or more of those draws with some other effect, the rest of Sylvan Library's ability still happens. If you've actually drawn only one card that turn, you must choose that card and either pay 4 life or put it on top of your library. If you haven't actually drawn any cards that turn, the rest of the ability has no effect.\"\n\nYou haven't actually [i]drawn[/i] any cards with abundance, so the rest of the ability has no effect.\n\nSo, yeah, @MANABURNWASGOOD, Abundance + Sylvan Library is grrrrreat!  As is this card on it's own.  ",
