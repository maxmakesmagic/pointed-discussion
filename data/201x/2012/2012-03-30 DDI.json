That's a bit of ramp *and* and bit of rainbow-fying, which is better than 'ritual mana' (producing more mana of the same color it costs to play) and maybe even better than 'rainbow mana' (only one land even though it taps for whatever you need)\n\nIn Gold decks, I don't think there's very much that does both ramp and colorizes.

Specifically, it doesn't involve ending your turn in the combat phase, but instead in the end step. Galepowder Mage creates a delayed-trigger ability that will trigger on the <i>next</i> end step, meaning it only triggers once. So you end the turn during that end step, which will exile all things on the stack, including the &quot;return that card to the battlefield&quot; ability. Sundial will create another end step, but the delayed-trigger ability has already triggered, and so it is satisfied and won't retrigger.",
   "text_posted": "@tcollins: Yeah, BastionQoU is right. You aren't correctly understanding either of [autocard]Galepowder Mage[/autocard] or [autocard]Sundial of the Infinite[/autocard]. Specifically, it doesn't involve ending your turn in the combat phase, but instead in the end step. Galepowder Mage creates a delayed-trigger ability that will trigger on the [i]next[/i] end step, meaning it only triggers once. So you end the turn during that end step, which will exile all things on the stack, including the \"return that card to the battlefield\" ability. Sundial will create another end step, but the delayed-trigger ability has already triggered, and so it is satisfied and won't retrigger.",
