Angels rival dragons; dragons have diamond-hard scales, general enormity, and powerful elemental breath attacks. Angels rival demons, who ripple with muscle and sinew, wield cruel weapons, and are often huge in size. Angels are humans with wings, phisiologically. They aren't large, they have no heavy muscle structure, and sometimes they have no weapons. Can't explain this away by saying they are magically enchanted, because the most powerful human wizards in magic are usually 3 or rarely 4 power or toughness. Yet here we have these winged ladies, who (generally) have untoned muscles and weak frames. Of course they have to be 5/6s or 6/7s because White needs a big flying creature, right? I guess so. And its okay if the angel in question is legendary, because if your skill in fighting makes you a 6/6 you'd better be famous. Its just that while Sphinxes, Demons, and Dragons rule the blue, black, and red skies, respectively, and half-naked ladies manage to lay down aerial beats in white, it makes me wonder why we don't have some kind of mythical beast flier evergreen in white. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lammasu\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lammasu\">Lammasu</a>? Maybe. Archons? Archons seem like humans too, but they always have a mount of some sort... so they are more acceptable than angels. I say no angel should be greater than 4/4 without showing some serious muscle, having explained skill, or being legendary like Razia or Akroma.<br />Angel of Salvation is a fine card, in every other way. Flash and Convoke are really excellent together. Flash on damage prevention is necessary if it is a one-shot, and a 5/5 flier package can show up to surprise block and attack right back the next turn. It might be a nice sideboard in an elf deck, depending on if you have elves that are hybrid or something, because you can expect your opponent to side in Pyroclasm or Volcanic Fallout for sure. Don't know any elf decks that use white but I think its a decent option.",

So, in essence, Pentavus is an Infinite/Infinite, you have Infinite 1/1 tokens, and you have Infinite colorless mana. I should ALSO mention, those tokens hit the graveyard and trigger any creature goes to the graveyard or creature enters battlefield effect. And his Infinite/Infinite strength is due to +1/+1 counters.",
