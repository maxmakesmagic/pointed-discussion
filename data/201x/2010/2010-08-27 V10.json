Artifacts are fragile, every color (with the exception of black) has something it can do to this card (and even black can toss out a 1 casting cost @Pithing Needle can pretty much mean they get rid of two cards with only one). That's called card advantage, when two threats are neutralized with one card.\n\nHow this thing got rated so high based on that, I'll never know, as it's rated even higher than the Morphling right now. \n\nNow, it is a fun card, and it has power to keep pouring on those two casting cost instants, but if you're going to imprint, imprint wisely, because while tossing down a Mana Drain imprinted scepter on your second turn might seem like an advantage, a Shatter, Disenchant, Naturalize, Boomerang, or Needle will pretty much mean they just removed that card from the game without much chance of you seeing it again. In this respect, the Isochron Scepter is little better than most Aura enchantments.",

If you have fast mana like that, you simply win against anyone without fast mana. Masticore happened to be the most powerful creature when you have tons of mana.

And now that RTR block Standard is almost over, I think we can all agree that AEtherling, at least in terms of tournament balance, has been a fair card. People think Morphling is the best blue creature because the deck Morphling was in won lots and lots of games; but the deck won lots and lots of games mostly because of every card in the deck being overpowered, from <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force Spike\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Force Spike\">Force Spike</a> to <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Counterspell\">Counterspell</a> to <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact or Fiction\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fact or Fiction\">Fact or Fiction</a>.

If they had AEtherling instead, they would have done the exact same thing. Counter everything, draw lots of cards, have full grip of counterspells, play Morphling/Rainbow Efreet/AEtherling, win.
