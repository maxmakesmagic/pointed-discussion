When I got home I opened it and was oh so pleasantly surprised when I saw all the old school cards that were in it! I lost all of my cards back about ten years ago, and to make a long story short I was so happy to get all these great cards! And the coalition deck has 3 of the dragons from invasion! Man this is a great deal to get some more good suicide black cards and it has a bunch of amazing artifacts in it including this card above which could seriously win you the game, phyrexian colossus, phyrexian plaguelord, phyrexian gargantua etc. And the coalition deck has a lot of mana accelerator creatures and a bunch of other good stuff! I would recommend this box set for sure, ESPECIALLY for someone like me that got out of touch from magic for a long time (and I quit playing right after the urza block) and wants to get back into it, or a beginner or even someone that just wants to double up on a bunch of these great cards.

Unlike the Elder Dragons, there is more than 1 playable card, and none of them are really brutal/broken (though Rith is easily the best). What's good about them is they are all chunky fliers, which means they'll never be un-relevant for combat once you slap any staple Equipments on them, and they are Allied Colored, which makes decks easier to plan and build. Lands and Mana Artifacts are more available for ally colors than for Enemy colors, and the Enemy Lands that do exist are harder to afford because they're *always* rare.<br /><br />For Treva, both her colors and her ability point very sharply towards a lifegain deck. I'd say a good Treva deck wants to use fewer Blue cards than Green/White cards, and try to gain as much life as possible. I don't know if her permanent-counting ability looks at just your cards or the whole table's cards, but either way you shouldn't have a problem after reading a few Rith lists that Doubling Season and Tokens are simply the best way to go. <br /><br />To make Treva feel much different than playing Rith though, I'd like to be more controlling and try to build a &quot;Pillowfort&quot; I can hide behind rather than rush out armies. Bant is the colors of Heroes, and trading Red for Blue can give us excellent Aura manipulation. I think Rafiq of the Many is a bit cheap to use as a General, but he's an awesome battlefield Champion to put in your 99. I've been inspired by the way the Guild Legends were designed for Ravnica: City of Guilds block to always include an additional Legendary creature in the exact color identity of my Commander to serve as a back-up 'Hero/Champion', and there's no denying Rafiq is one of the best go-to options for {G}{W}{U}.<br /><br /><br />Commander: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treva, the Renewer\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Treva, the Renewer\">Treva, the Renewer</a><br />Champion: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rafiq of the Many\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rafiq of the Many\">Rafiq of the Many</a><br />Theme: Enchantments, Lifegain, Exalted<br /><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrace Angel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Battlegrace Angel\">Battlegrace Angel</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic Angel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Stoic Angel\">Stoic Angel</a>, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sublime Archangel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sublime Archangel\">Sublime Archangel</a> are good picks to support the Exalted Rafiq and the tokens you'll be making with Treva's ability. I'm not going to write out a whole list but just gently suggest the kinda-sorta direction I'd want to take this Legend in.<br /><br />I also think nowhere other than Treva will you have more reason to play <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Levitation\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Levitation\">Levitation</a>, a Blue spell that really wants you to play tokens. I like the idea of giving an army flying, but it doesn't usually feel practical compared to other options you have. Rith in particular scoffs at Flying because she'd rather just have Haste anyway. I think this is a great place where you can use Treva's third color to make your deck play really differently from the ho-hum ''usual'' Green-White decks. It's Selesnya week on various MTG sites, and Green-White plays SO well together that Green-White-Red and Green-White-Black and Green-White-Blue really do feel close to the same: they're probably all token decks, some exploiting enters-the-battlefield abilities, some just being huge dorky armies. Usually, Huge Dorky Armies don't FLY, though. Cathar's Crusade + Levitation would be my pick for fighting Kaalia in her own element: Having epic clashes on the battlefield- or in the skies over the battlefield!  I'd say Kaalia should want to kill and trade as much as possible and then Liliana everyone's everything out, while Treva should play the Good Guy and try to protect all of her allies with Avacyn and Elspeth, thwarting the Zombies plan.<br /><br />For the same reason I don't think Rafiq should be your Commander, I don't think <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar Sovereign\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Felidar Sovereign\">Felidar Sovereign</a> is a nice card to play in EDH. It's just too Spikey, and Spikeyness tends to go against the spirit of the format.
