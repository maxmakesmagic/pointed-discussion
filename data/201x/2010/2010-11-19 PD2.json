Excluding [autocard]Karn[/autocard], [autocard]Nicol Bolas[/autocard], and [autocard]Venser[/autocard], who were inspired by their own card and character. In my opinion, I think it would go like this:\n\n[b][autocard]Chandra[/autocard]-[autocard]Jaya Ballard, Task Mage[/autocard]:[/b] Both are red aligned hot headed pyromaniac women who love to set stuff on fire.\n\n[b][autocard]Jace[/autocard]-[autocard] Arcanis the Omnipotent[/autocard]:[/b] Both are blue aligned wizards specializing in mind powers and mental dominance.\n\n[b][autocard]Ajani[/autocard]-Lord Windgrace:[/b] Lord Windgrace was one of the planeswalkers who joined with Urza to fight against the Phyrexians. You can see him on the cards [autocard]Planeswalker's Fury[/autocard] and [autocard]Divine Light[/autocard]. Although Plainswalkers of that time were not color associated, Lord Windgrace is considered to be mostly red and white, like Ajani. Lord Windgace could also be argued to be the inspiration for [autocard]Gideon[/autocard], as both planeswalkers enjoy being on the front lines and fighting their opponents face-to-face.\n\n[b][autocard]Liliana[/autocard]-[autocard]Gwendlyn Di Corci[/autocard]:[/b] Both Liliana and Gwendlyn are primarily black aligned necromancers, extremely beautiful ([i]according to the plot[/i]), and extremely manipulative.\n\n[b][autocard]Sorrin[/autocard]-[autocard]Baron Sengir[/autocard]:[/b] Both are black aligned vampires who are more uncaring and hedonistic than actively evil.\n\n[b][autocard]Tezzeret[/autocard]-Urza:[/b] Both Urza and Tezzeret are artificers whose thirst for knowledge and power led them down a dark path ([i]Urza fought his own brother for the [autocard]Mightstone[/autocard] and the [autocard]Meekstone[/autocard], while Tezzeret's search for the Codex Etherium led him into the clutches of [autocard]Nicol Bolas[/autocard][/i]) Also, both were corrupted and driven mad by evil forces ([i]Urza by Phyrexia, and Tezzeret by Nicol Bolas[/i])\n\n[b][autocard]Elsepth[/autocard]-[autocard]Serra[/autocard]:[/b] Both Elsepth and Serra are powerful warriors who have strong beliefs in justice and protecting the innocent. Both are also extremely merciless in the pursuit of justice.\n\n[b][autocard]Garruk[/autocard]-[autocard]Kamahl, Fist of Krosa[/autocard]:[/b] Although Garruk and Kamahl don't seem as clearly similar as the others, Garruk takes after Kamahl in many ways. Garruk could be seen as a fusion of both sides of Kamahl. From Kamahls pit fighting days, Garruk gets his love of combat and his martial prowess, and from Kamahls redemption as a druid Garruk gets his deep respect for nature.\n\n[b][autocard]Nissa Revane[/autocard]-[autocard]Eladamri, Lord of Leaves[/autocard]:[/b] Both Nissa and Eladamri are territorial, charismatic elves who believe in elvish superiority over all other races.\n\n[b][autocard]Sarkhan Vol[/autocard]-[autocard]Rorix Bladewing[/autocard]:[/b] Both Sarkhan and Rorix are extreme dragon supremacists, and both have been corrupted by black magic ([i]Sarkhan was driven insane, while Rorix was resurrected as a zombie[/i]).\n\nWell, that's all I've got. I know I missed a few planeswalkers ([i][autocard]Taimyo[/autocard], [autocard]Tibalt[/autocard] and [autocard]Koth[/autocard][/i]) but just because I can't think of the character that inspired them doesn't mean it doesn't exist.",
