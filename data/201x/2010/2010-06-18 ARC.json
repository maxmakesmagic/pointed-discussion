Not necesarily in that order. >:D\r\n\r\n\r\nThis card would be relatively unimpressive compared to a simple Diabolic (let alone Demonic) Tutor, if it weren't for the crucial unevenness of information!\r\n\r\nDon't think of this as a 'real' tutor--real tutor's get you card quality and sometimes even card advantage. Three heroes that are going into a Fortress KNOWING you are an evil bastard out to kill them and you give them each a tutor?  they WILL get more and better cards than you.\r\n\r\nRofl-lol you sneaky bastard....you WANT this to happen!!!! \r\n\r\nYou get see what they get, and you know whether or not you need to search out Wrath of God, or Counterspell, or Mind Shatter.  Maybe you just need a good ol' fashioned Disk. This is the Next Level of Painful choice cards-- if they get 'bad' stuff, knowing you are trying to draw out their champions, then you can get something that's just bigger and meaner.  If they get good stuff, you can sabotage them. If they read this comment, they won't know which you'll do and they'll cry at the stress- and if they don't, they'll fall right into your trap anyway. \r\n\r\nThis is the most Evil Deathtrap in Magic. And it comes, like all good deathtraps, wrapped like a PRESENT for them! \r\n\r\nYou are peeking through time. Spying the Future, then counterplanning against it. This is the moment the villain spies on the heroes, and they don't know he's there.\r\n\r\nYou want them to get their very best goodies out NOW, force their hand, then Open the Black Gates!\r\nThen [autocard]Counterspell[/autocard] them. Like A Boss. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you realize what you can really do with this card, and your opponents realize you realize what you can do with this card, THEN they will be too terrified that you will silver-bullet their pets to stop you.....\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom fetching your combo pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN, I love being EVIL!!!!!!!!",

Yeah, there are times when one of those cards will help you more than this would help you.  But while both of those effects may (and that's a big &quot;may&quot;) help you more in the right scenario, this one has the biggest advantage any scheme card can dream for: it's as good on turn 1 as on turn 10, and just as good no matter what the board looks like.  If you get <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=My Crushing Masterstroke\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"My Crushing Masterstroke\">My Crushing Masterstroke</a> when the Heroes all have 2+ creatures down, it's likely better.  But if 1) one (or more) of your opponents is playing a creature-light deck (very likely since control seems to be great against Archenemies) or 2) it's still early in the game and your opponents all have one 1/2 creature out, it may as well be <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=A Display of my Dark Power\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"A Display of my Dark Power\">A Display of my Dark Power</a>.  And if you have a strong enough board position - again, very likely in Archenemy - two attacks with all of your creatures against a (possibly tapped out) opponent could be much more powerful than one attack against each opponent with their own creatures plus one attack with all of yours.<br /><br />Since you have no control over when you play them, the most important thing in a Scheme card is flexibility.  Many schemes with great effects can end up being completely useless if you draw them at the wrong time.  So while yeah, at turn 8 against a bunch of creature-heavy decks I'd rather draw <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=My Crushing Masterstroke\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"My Crushing Masterstroke\">My Crushing Masterstroke</a>, the fact that at best it will give me a slight advantage over <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All in Good Time\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"All in Good Time\">All in Good Time</a> and at worst will do literally nothing tips my favor towards this one.<br /><br />That's not to say that <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth, Claw, and Tail\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Tooth, Claw, and Tail\">Tooth, Claw, and Tail</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=My Crushing Masterstroke\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"My Crushing Masterstroke\">My Crushing Masterstroke</a> are poor Schemes.

Assuming your opening hand contains two lands (plus the Tusker and Wolf), here are the possibilities:<br /><br />#1 - Forest, Forest: The Tusker is castable, the Wolf is not. (Score: 1/0 for the Tusker)<br />#2 - Plains, Plains: Neither the Tusker nor the Wolf are castable. (Score: 1/0 for the Tusker)<br />#3 - Forest, Plains: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Score: 1/1 Tie)<br />#4 - Plains, Forest: The Tusker is not castable, but the Wolf is. (Final Score: 1/2 for the Wolf)<br /><br />It's interesting to note that the odds of scenarios #1 or #2 happening are slightly lower than the odds of scenarios #3 or #4 happening. This is because drawing your second Forest or Plains is less likely once you've already taken one of the desired lands from the deck. On the contrary, finding a Plains after your first Forest or a Forest after your first Plains is <i>more</i> likely because the unwanted land has become less common in the deck. With this in mind, the Watchwolf's chances of being castable here on Turn 2 are actually slightly higher than the 50% &quot;coin toss&quot; chance that you might expect.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>Dual Selesnya</b></u><br /><br />(Kalonian Tusker Casting Odds: 42.63%, Watchwolf Casting Odds: 79.29%)<br /><br />Now let's try a more developed manabase: 8 Forests, 8 Plains, 8 <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253681\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"253681\">Temple Gardens</a>. Assuming that having 8 Temple Gardens is even legal here, and that your opening hand contains two lands (plus the Tusker and Wolf), here are the possibilities:<br /><br />#1 - Forest, Forest: The Tusker is castable, the Wolf is not.

(Final Score: 4/7 for the Wolf)<br /><br />Like in the Basic Selesnya example above, the Wolf gets a slight probability advantage over the Tusker due to the inherent difficulty associated with drawing multiples of a desired card.

   "text_parsed": "<b>Aaron’s Random Card Comment of the Day #41, 11/29/10</b>\r<br />\r<br />With most keywords, you want there to be some super-splashy implementations that show off the full breadth and power of what the mechanic has to offer, but you also need what I call “quota-filling cards”—cards that are the most predictable baseline execution. Spider Umbra is one of the latter.\r<br />\r<br />Originally, this Aura gave the enchanted creature deathtouch, but it changed for two reasons. One, we wanted to minimize the number of times deathtouch appeared in the set because it is particularly harsh to levelers and the other high-investment fatties in the set. And two, deathtouch reminder text wouldn’t fit on the card alongside the totem armor reminder text. So it was changed to +1/+1 and reach, which basically served the same purpose—to slow limited games down so that the more expensive cards could come out to play.\r<br />\r<br />Totem armor was a tough mechanic to get right in development, not from a power-level perspective, but from a “how exactly is this supposed to work” perspective. We bandied around all sorts of ideas, from sacrificing the Aura to make the creature indestructible, to having the Aura replace the creature going to the graveyard in any fashion, including sacrificing. In the end, the developers and the rules people went with this version, which very closely mimics regeneration in that it replaces destruction with the removal of damage. While this version of totem armor won’t save your creatures from sacrifice effects like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All Is Dust\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"All Is Dust\">All Is Dust</a>, it isn’t technically regeneration, so it still works against “anti-regen” cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath of God\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Wrath of God\">Wrath of God</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Incinerate\">Incinerate</a>.\r<br />\r<br />The best part of this mechanic, as far as I'm concerned, though, is the art.

   "text_posted": "[b]Aaron’s Random Card Comment of the Day #41, 11/29/10[/b]\r\n\r\nWith most keywords, you want there to be some super-splashy implementations that show off the full breadth and power of what the mechanic has to offer, but you also need what I call “quota-filling cards”—cards that are the most predictable baseline execution. Spider Umbra is one of the latter.\r\n\r\nOriginally, this Aura gave the enchanted creature deathtouch, but it changed for two reasons. One, we wanted to minimize the number of times deathtouch appeared in the set because it is particularly harsh to levelers and the other high-investment fatties in the set. And two, deathtouch reminder text wouldn’t fit on the card alongside the totem armor reminder text. So it was changed to +1/+1 and reach, which basically served the same purpose—to slow limited games down so that the more expensive cards could come out to play.\r\n\r\nTotem armor was a tough mechanic to get right in development, not from a power-level perspective, but from a “how exactly is this supposed to work” perspective. We bandied around all sorts of ideas, from sacrificing the Aura to make the creature indestructible, to having the Aura replace the creature going to the graveyard in any fashion, including sacrificing. In the end, the developers and the rules people went with this version, which very closely mimics regeneration in that it replaces destruction with the removal of damage. While this version of totem armor won’t save your creatures from sacrifice effects like [autocard]All Is Dust[/autocard], it isn’t technically regeneration, so it still works against “anti-regen” cards like [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard] and [autocard]Incinerate[/autocard].\r\n\r\nThe best part of this mechanic, as far as I'm concerned, though, is the art. Each one shows someone \"driving\" a ghostly version of the animal in the card's name. I love it!",

It's got inherent weaknesses.\n\nKaalia is scary the way that highly-illegally modified fighter that you just KNOW is being piloted by their Best Flier is scary. It is Much Faster and gives you less time, even if landing the right blow does blow it completely to space dust. It can also think a bit better than the average Battleship.\n\nGriselbrand is scary the way a Sith Lord walking into the room is scary. No normal human ever survives such an encounter, and in fact a lot of people tend to die all at once when it happens. X.X :O :O :O",
