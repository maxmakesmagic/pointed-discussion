These are straight hitting power creatures, I didn't bother to pick creatures that were good because of their gimmicky powers like Specters and what not. Apples and oranges in my opinion... Anyhoooooo\r<br />\r<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration Elemental\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Desecration Elemental\">Desecration Elemental</a> : 8/8, fear, squishes creatures all day. The only real con here is you can't really play it early or it'll just end up eating itself. \r<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Korlash, Heir to Blackblade\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Korlash, Heir to Blackblade\">Korlash, Heir to Blackblade</a> : Could be massive. Legendary though so you can only have one in play. Not that you really need more.\r<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning Demon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Grinning Demon\">Grinning Demon</a> : Basically a stronger version of Juzam. Pound for pound, you aren't doing much more damage compared to what you are taking. \r<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mortivore\">Mortivore</a> : Could be a huge creature. Again though, not something you are playing on turn one. I suppose you can pull some fancy crap and get it out early AND buff...\r<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind Maggots\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mind Maggots\">Mind Maggots</a> : One of the best in the list. You could really ***-slap someone with this given the right draw. \r<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague Sliver\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Plague Sliver\">Plague Sliver</a> : Pretty much the same thing as Juzam, but it's a Sliver so there's really no telling what you could do to it. Of course that only increases the amount of damage you are going to take. \r<br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless One\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Soulless One\">Soulless One</a> : Could be massive.

   "text_posted": "So because I'm a total geek I just looked through every black creature card with CMC of 4. 9 pages of creatures I only found 11 that met or beat Juzam. These are in alphabetical order not order of \"goodness\". These are straight hitting power creatures, I didn't bother to pick creatures that were good because of their gimmicky powers like Specters and what not. Apples and oranges in my opinion... Anyhoooooo\r\n\r\n[autocard]Desecration Elemental[/autocard] : 8/8, fear, squishes creatures all day. The only real con here is you can't really play it early or it'll just end up eating itself. \r\n[autocard]Korlash, Heir to Blackblade[/autocard] : Could be massive. Legendary though so you can only have one in play. Not that you really need more.\r\n[autocard]Grinning Demon[/autocard] : Basically a stronger version of Juzam. Pound for pound, you aren't doing much more damage compared to what you are taking. \r\n[autocard]Mortivore[/autocard] : Could be a huge creature. Again though, not something you are playing on turn one. I suppose you can pull some fancy crap and get it out early AND buff...\r\n[autocard]Mind Maggots[/autocard] : One of the best in the list. You could really bytch-slap someone with this given the right draw. \r\n[autocard]Plague Sliver[/autocard] : Pretty much the same thing as Juzam, but it's a Sliver so there's really no telling what you could do to it.

Whoever has been charged with the task of maintaining errata that is representative of the original and intended use of cards for the past ten years has failed miserably.",

   "text_parsed": "The History of <b>Shahrazad</b>: Part 3 of 3<br /><br /><b><i>The players had roughly the same chance of winning the subgame as they did of winning the main game.</i></b> This brings us to a part of <b>Shahrazad</b>’s history that many players are not familiar with. For a time, <b>Shahrazad</b> was one of the most powerful cards in Magic. When <b>Shahrazad</b> was printed, the exile zone hadn’t been invented yet. In fact, Arabian Nights introduced the concept of manipulating cards outside the game with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring of Ma’ruf\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ring of Ma’ruf\">Ring of Ma’ruf</a>, a concept so radical at the time that they italicized the words “outside the game” on the original card just to show how awesome it was. Then Antiquities brought us <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze Tablet\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Bronze Tablet\">Bronze Tablet</a>, a card so bizarre you’ll just have to look it up yourself. Basically, removing stuff from the game was weird back then. Then, after Legends, The Dark came along and made removing from the game a regular thing, but not nearly as prevalent as exile is now. When stuff got removed from the game back then, it was really gone. In fact, if it got removed from the game during a <b>Shahrazad</b> subgame, it was gone in the main game too. As graveyard recursion and removing from the game became more commonplace, <b>Shahrazad</b> became not only a nuisance (it was one of the first banned cards) but it also became a powerhouse. As soon as you could resolve a <b>Shahrazad</b>, you could just slowly pick away at an opponent’s library within subgames until their deck was removed from the game. Then you would just win the main game due to the empty library draw rule.<br /><br />Another potential abuse strategy was to use <b>Shahrazad</b> in a tournament sideboard. You would win the first game of a match as normal, on your deck’s own merits. However, in sideboarding your deck would transform. Rather than trying to win, you would try to drag the game out forever, resulting in a draw for the second game of the match due to time constraints and an overall match win. Sadly, stalling and delaying is still a tactic sometimes employed by more unscrupulous tournament competitors, but <b>Shahrazad</b> made it absurdly easy and effective. The process of mulligan-taking for a single game alone could eat up several minutes. This potential for abuse is what ultimately led to the banning of <b>Shahrazad</b> in Vintage and Legacy formats.<br /><br />For a long time, <b>Shahrazad</b> was up there with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contract From Below\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Contract From Below\">Contract From Below</a> as terrifyingly powerful cards that would dwarf the power 9, if only they were legal. Of course, with the introduction of the exile zone, cards exiled by <b>Shahrazad</b> now return to the original game, taking away its extreme power, though not its extreme capacity to annoy. For years most copies of <b>Shahrazad</b> lay squirrelled away in binders, unused and forgotten. With it being banned in all formats, <b>Shahrazad</b> would very rarely show up in an actual game, and even then only as an eccentric novelty.<br /><br /><b>Shahrazad</b> has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity lately. For a short time, the card was allowed in the official Elder Dragon Highlander rules. The single-card rule prevented game-within-a-game headaches. The casual tone of the format makes delaying tactics pointless. Furthermore, EDH is the perfect place to use strange and silly old cards. Unfortunately, those in charge of the official EDH rules realized that the average player can’t be trusted not to copy and recast <b>Shahrazad</b> and run games into oblivion, and it has again become an outlaw in all sanctioned formats.<br /><br />So what’s the situation with <b>Shahrazad</b> now?  Well, for one thing, it’s valuable. You can expect to pay about $40 for a used one and even more for one in mint condition. Ironically, it’s also much easier to obtain than it used to be 20 years ago. The savvier internet shopper could arrange to have one sent directly to his or her mailbox at the lowest available price in the world within a minute of finishing this sentence. In the rare circles of friends that can resist the urge to ruin games with it, <b>Shahrazad</b> is even cast in EDH or casual games every now and then!<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed reading about <b>Shahrazad</b>! If you have an interesting story about <b>Shahrazad</b>, if you know something I don’t about the card, if I’ve included something untrue, or if you’d just like to chat with a fellow geek, I’d love to correspond.

You would win the first game of a match as normal, on your deck’s own merits. However, in sideboarding your deck would transform. Rather than trying to win, you would try to drag the game out forever, resulting in a draw for the second game of the match due to time constraints and an overall match win. Sadly, stalling and delaying is still a tactic sometimes employed by more unscrupulous tournament competitors, but [b]Shahrazad[/b] made it absurdly easy and effective. The process of mulligan-taking for a single game alone could eat up several minutes. This potential for abuse is what ultimately led to the banning of [b]Shahrazad[/b] in Vintage and Legacy formats.\n\nFor a long time, [b]Shahrazad[/b] was up there with [autocard]Contract From Below[/autocard] as terrifyingly powerful cards that would dwarf the power 9, if only they were legal. Of course, with the introduction of the exile zone, cards exiled by [b]Shahrazad[/b] now return to the original game, taking away its extreme power, though not its extreme capacity to annoy. For years most copies of [b]Shahrazad[/b] lay squirrelled away in binders, unused and forgotten. With it being banned in all formats, [b]Shahrazad[/b] would very rarely show up in an actual game, and even then only as an eccentric novelty.\n\n[b]Shahrazad[/b] has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity lately. For a short time, the card was allowed in the official Elder Dragon Highlander rules. The single-card rule prevented game-within-a-game headaches. The casual tone of the format makes delaying tactics pointless. Furthermore, EDH is the perfect place to use strange and silly old cards. Unfortunately, those in charge of the official EDH rules realized that the average player can’t be trusted not to copy and recast [b]Shahrazad[/b] and run games into oblivion, and it has again become an outlaw in all sanctioned formats.\n\nSo what’s the situation with [b]Shahrazad[/b] now?  Well, for one thing, it’s valuable. You can expect to pay about $40 for a used one and even more for one in mint condition. Ironically, it’s also much easier to obtain than it used to be 20 years ago. The savvier internet shopper could arrange to have one sent directly to his or her mailbox at the lowest available price in the world within a minute of finishing this sentence. In the rare circles of friends that can resist the urge to ruin games with it, [b]Shahrazad[/b] is even cast in EDH or casual games every now and then!\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading about [b]Shahrazad[/b]! If you have an interesting story about [b]Shahrazad[/b], if you know something I don’t about the card, if I’ve included something untrue, or if you’d just like to chat with a fellow geek, I’d love to correspond.

Yet that’s just the start of the story of <b>Shahrazad</b>. Let’s discuss how the card itself has been used (and abused!) since it was printed 20 years ago.<br /><br />When Magic was first created, nobody imagined what it would become. It was printed with the assumption that local groups would just buy a few cards. There wasn’t supposed to be more than one or two of any given rare in the few hundred groups of hardcore roleplaying/hobby enthusiasts that would actually buy more than the starter sets. When Arabian Nights was printed, the game had been out for about 3 months. It was starting to take off, but so far only Alpha and Beta had been printed and the assumption that rares would actually be rare still held. In fact, there wasn’t even a “4-in-a-deck” rule. It just wasn’t necessary because it was impossible to get that many copies of a rare. Unless you were some sort of technology wizard, you probably hadn’t even heard of the internet, let alone online shopping. If you lived in a major city that actually had a hobby store they wouldn’t have even thought to sell individual cards from the game Magic: The Gathering. You can imagine why those who are lucky enough to have those cards are able to sell them for thousands of dollars today.<br /><br />So where does <b>Shahrazad</b> fit in? Well, it made the card usable. Fun and balanced even. If somebody actually had a <b>Shahrazad</b> in their deck, they probably just had the one. On the rare occasions somebody played it, it just added an interesting element of diversion to the game. Once the card hit the graveyard, it was probably going to stay there. The players had roughly the same chance of winning the subgame as they did of winning the main game. Of course, every statement in this paragraph became completely untrue as the game evolved… let’s go through them.<br /><br /><b><i>It made the card usable.

As Magic grew, this became completely untrue. People started finetuning decks and collecting multiples of powerful cards. The 4-of-a-card limit had to be introduced. Playing a subgame of Magic once every few games might be fun, but playing 2 or 3 subgames in every game is just tiresome. This makes the most terrifying element of <b>Shahrazad</b> to the table. If you have more than one in your deck, you can play a subgame within a subgame. This is VERY tiresome. If you thought the film Inception was confusing, try keeping track of 3 (or more!) sets of life totals in a Magic game with multiple copies of <b>Shahrazad</b>. It’s not as fun as it sounds, and it doesn’t sound all that fun. <br /><br /><i><b>Once the card hit the graveyard, it was probably going to stay there.</b></i> In the original game of Magic, the graveyard was not nearly as much a part of the game as it is now. Today’s exile zone is more accessible than the graveyard of those times. Occasionally, a creature might gruesomely be returned from the dead by black magic. But that creature probably got to the graveyard the fair way, by dying in combat. When it came to reusing spells, only the unique green spell <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regrowth\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Regrowth\">Regrowth</a> could do that, although the temporal manipulation of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timetwister\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Timetwister\">Timetwister</a> could also do it in a roundabout way. If anybody ever did make a <b>Shahrazad</b>/Regrowth deck, I’m sure it was a great joke but quickly became unpopular. 2 or 3 subgames is just tiresome. Nowadays, cards in the graveyard are almost as easy to play as cards in your hand, if not easier. If somebody does have a <b>Shahrazad</b> recursion deck, you can expect to play 2 or 3 subgames every single turn of the main game. Ugh. Not to mention that it can easily be copied by spells like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Fork\">Fork</a>. That’s not even considering the possibility subgames within subgames. I shudder to think.",

Shahrazad’s role in the story is that of the narrator. After betraying her husband, the king Shahryar, she tells him stories to delay her execution. That is to say, she tells a story within a story, just like <b>Shahrazad</b> the card creates a game within a game. Also, each story ends with a cliffhanger so that the story never really ends.
