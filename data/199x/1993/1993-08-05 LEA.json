The first verse reflects the titular character's frustration with wanting to keep his unique identity instead of being lumped in with other pachyderms.<br />In the chorus, he finds solace in sharing his experience with another alpha card.<br />The second verse describes Dwarven Recruiter's frustration with how Dwarves never got the support that Goblins did, appearing briefly as recently as Shadowmoor block only to never be heard from again. The highlights of the Dwarves glorious history are touched on briefly.<br />Finally, we return to the titular character in a modern magic environment. Although he is confused at first, he finds salvation upon discovering the &quot;combo&quot; of R&amp;D's Secret Lair and Infinite Reflections, allowing him to maintain his mammoth-hood and meet others just like him!",

The first verse reflects the titular character's frustration with wanting to keep his unique identity instead of being lumped in with other pachyderms.\nIn the chorus, he finds solace in sharing his experience with another alpha card.\nThe second verse describes Dwarven Recruiter's frustration with how Dwarves never got the support that Goblins did, appearing briefly as recently as Shadowmoor block only to never be heard from again. The highlights of the Dwarves glorious history are touched on briefly.\nFinally, we return to the titular character in a modern magic environment. Although he is confused at first, he finds salvation upon discovering the \"combo\" of R&D's Secret Lair and Infinite Reflections, allowing him to maintain his mammoth-hood and meet others just like him!",

   "text_parsed": "@D|CK<br />I hate trolls who think they are hot sh*t because they play for ante and put others down for disliking it. It's extremely disingenuous and not sportsmanlike at all.<br /><br />Ante is a bad concept. It completely eliminates casual play and turns every game into a fear fest because you might lose your cards. It is <i>supposed to</i> add excitement and suspense to the game because you might win a card, but I don't find stealing peoples cards much fun at all, especially if it was a close match or a really good game. Makes me feel wrong inside. It also discourages new or unskilled players from playing because they know they will probably lose. Even if they don't care if they lose because they just like to play the game, ante will make them care because something is at stake. Also, ante benefits all those arrogant rich kids who have the money to buy 300 booster packs and get all those <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black Lotus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Black Lotus\">Black Lotus</a>es. Ante makes playing for fun impossible. Magic should be a casual, fun game that anyone can play. Magic is not poker.<br /><br />IMO, ante is a terrible rule, but if you play with ante, this card can be good. It is situational in regards that you will only play it if you are winning, and it will either outright win you the game (from your opponent conceding) or you can win an extra card, in the rare exception this backfires on you and you wind up losing. This also, more times than not, just makes your opponent hate you even more than they already do. This is also very black to me.<br /><br />The problem is that a card like this doesn't actually do anything to help you win the game. It changes nothing about the player's states. It would be much better to run a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=86\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardid=\"86\">Terror</a> instead most of the time.<br /><br />Even though I hate ante, I will rate purely on objective usefulness of the card. I give it a 1/5, since it is situational (as you must already be winning for it to be practical) and will waste a card slot if you are losing.

   "text_posted": "@D|CK\nI hate trolls who think they are hot sh*t because they play for ante and put others down for disliking it. It's extremely disingenuous and not sportsmanlike at all.\n\nAnte is a bad concept. It completely eliminates casual play and turns every game into a fear fest because you might lose your cards. It is [i]supposed to[/i] add excitement and suspense to the game because you might win a card, but I don't find stealing peoples cards much fun at all, especially if it was a close match or a really good game. Makes me feel wrong inside. It also discourages new or unskilled players from playing because they know they will probably lose. Even if they don't care if they lose because they just like to play the game, ante will make them care because something is at stake.
