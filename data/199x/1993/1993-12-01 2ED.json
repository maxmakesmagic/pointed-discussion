If your good or experienced, you think it is completely broken. Black Lotus is hands down the best card in the game. It is a crime that this thing is not 5 stars. It is (as someone else said) the Holy Grail of <b>Magic</b>.<br /><br />Some may argue that other members of the Power 9 and other good cards are the best. Mainly, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral Recall\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ancestral Recall\">Ancestral Recall</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time Walk\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Time Walk\">Time Walk</a>. While these cards break the game in half as well, they can't be put into any deck the way that the Black Lotus can. Technically, you can but they wont be good if your playing non-blue. Black Lotus improves any deck.<br /><br />Some of the people who rate this down are upset about the massive price tag and how the they can't be competitive in Vintage without it. If you don't want to pay thousands of dollars on cards, go play Legacy. Its banned there, I believe (I'm not a tournament player) so just have fun there. Don't get mad at cards like these. Don't be mad at the original creators either, the game was in its infancy. Its different nowadays where Wizards already knows how to balance the game but still print cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer Angel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Baneslayer Angel\">Baneslayer Angel</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace, the Mind Sculptor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jace, the Mind Sculptor\">Jace, the Mind Sculptor</a>. If you don't like those cards go ahead and rate them down. Be my guest. But don't be mad at this little flower, it didn't know better.",
   "text_posted": "What I love about this card is how it works as a test. If your a noob (and we have all been there) you think it sucks. If your good or experienced, you think it is completely broken. Black Lotus is hands down the best card in the game. It is a crime that this thing is not 5 stars. It is (as someone else said) the Holy Grail of [b]Magic[/b].\n\nSome may argue that other members of the Power 9 and other good cards are the best. Mainly, [autocard]Ancestral Recall[/autocard] and [autocard]Time Walk[/autocard]. While these cards break the game in half as well, they can't be put into any deck the way that the Black Lotus can. Technically, you can but they wont be good if your playing non-blue. Black Lotus improves any deck.\n\nSome of the people who rate this down are upset about the massive price tag and how the they can't be competitive in Vintage without it. If you don't want to pay thousands of dollars on cards, go play Legacy. Its banned there, I believe (I'm not a tournament player) so just have fun there. Don't get mad at cards like these. Don't be mad at the original creators either, the game was in its infancy. Its different nowadays where Wizards already knows how to balance the game but still print cards like [autocard]Baneslayer Angel[/autocard] or [autocard]Jace, the Mind Sculptor[/autocard].

But as mentioned, Time Vault and Mana Vault and similar had exceptions to still having to pay for untapping.",

For that reason, Ancestral Recall, which gets you 3 cards, is better than Black Lotus, which gets you 3 mana. Just in case someone else thinks of this, the cost to make something instant speed is either 1 or U. Therefore, the ability to cast Ancestral at instant speed makes up for the greater cost. <br />Finally, on the subject of Unrestricted Vintage, it's a VERY different format from restricted Vintage. It's basically divided into combo decks that go off on turn 1 95% of the time or higher, and decks designed to combat them.

Basically, every game is decided on the first turn, which is a single blindingly fast turn of tremendous interaction. I've played many games in this format, and the speed tradeoff for having spaces open for counters and discard, as supposed to card draw, tutors, and fast mana, is just not a good one.

   "text_parsed": "A funny, somewhat awe-inspiring  event unfolded in front of me a couple months ago. True story;<br /><br />Recently I was at my LGS, talking to a guy who I haven't seen their before. He was probably around  25 or so, and was discussing with me how he hadn't played MTG in a very long time,  seeing as he used to play with his older brother when they were youngsters. He told me how he was walking by the store, saw MTG being advertised and figured he would walk in, see how the game is currently, browse for a second, ect. He told me how he was confused by planeswalkers, sort of thought it seemed like they were taking the place of legendary creatures, and how different the cards look from when he played, ect. Stuff you'd expect from a guy who quit around Legends or so.<br /><br />Eventually, while he was looking at the display case,  he saw a signed version of this card. His eyes opened wide and his mouth dropped when he saw the price written on the sleeve. It was going for $700.  He then said to me &quot;Wow, why is that card so expensive?!&quot; He paused, seemed to ponder something for a moment, looked at the card, and said &quot;It must have to do with the fact its signed. That makes sense. I have 5 of these back home. There's no way it's worth that much! Do you know how much these go for unsigned? Like what, 20 bucks or something?&quot;. At this point my mouth was probably about twice as wide as when he first noticed the price. I figured I'd help him out as much as I could, not wanting someone to basically steal from him if he ever decided to sell them in a transaction. I told him &quot;Well, it depends on a lot of factors. The condition matters a lot, but even more important is what set it was from. Do you remember what set it was from at all?&quot; He responded quickly; &quot;Yes clearly. The majority of my collection was from the first set, back when the game was brand new. My brother and I opened a ton of these, and I still have at least five copies at my parents house!&quot;<br /><br />I was in awe. This guy had 5 copies of Alpha Ancestral Recall just sitting in his room back home, and according to him many were close to mint condition. So rather than tell him my guess as to the price, I directed him to the store clerk, who is friendly and always willing to look up the price of cards for people in the store. After a moment, the store clerk told the man &quot;Near mint Alpha Ancestral Recall goes for about... $2000.&quot; The customer seemed amazed. No, he <i>was</i> amazed. I talked to him for a few more minutes after that, he seemed to be a very happy camper from then on. Of course, I'm sure I would be too if I just found out I had an extra $10,000 worth of value to my name. I'm just glad I got to help this fellow out before he did something crazy, like sell them for 20 bucks each, and I'd say his overjoyed reaction was plenty payment. I love moments like this and just want to share.<br /><br />Now, onto the card itself:<br /><br />This is arguably the most powerful card in the game. I'd say even more so than <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black Lotus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Black Lotus\">Black Lotus</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time Walk\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Time Walk\">Time Walk</a>, though their both undoubtedly close seconds. But they just can't compare to the ridiculously efficient card advantage this card can generate. At instant speed, no less.<br /><br />This card is bonkers.",

That makes sense. I have 5 of these back home. There's no way it's worth that much! Do you know how much these go for unsigned? Like what, 20 bucks or something?\". At this point my mouth was probably about twice as wide as when he first noticed the price. I figured I'd help him out as much as I could, not wanting someone to basically steal from him if he ever decided to sell them in a transaction. I told him \"Well, it depends on a lot of factors. The condition matters a lot, but even more important is what set it was from. Do you remember what set it was from at all?\" He responded quickly; \"Yes clearly. The majority of my collection was from the first set, back when the game was brand new. My brother and I opened a ton of these, and I still have at least five copies at my parents house!\"\n\nI was in awe. This guy had 5 copies of Alpha Ancestral Recall just sitting in his room back home, and according to him many were close to mint condition. So rather than tell him my guess as to the price, I directed him to the store clerk, who is friendly and always willing to look up the price of cards for people in the store. After a moment, the store clerk told the man \"Near mint Alpha Ancestral Recall goes for about... $2000.\" The customer seemed amazed. No, he [i]was[/i] amazed. I talked to him for a few more minutes after that, he seemed to be a very happy camper from then on. Of course, I'm sure I would be too if I just found out I had an extra $10,000 worth of value to my name. I'm just glad I got to help this fellow out before he did something crazy, like sell them for 20 bucks each, and I'd say his overjoyed reaction was plenty payment. I love moments like this and just want to share.\n\nNow, onto the card itself:\n\nThis is arguably the most powerful card in the game. I'd say even more so than [autocard]Black Lotus[/autocard] and [autocard]Time Walk[/autocard], though their both undoubtedly close seconds. But they just can't compare to the ridiculously efficient card advantage this card can generate. At instant speed, no less.\n\nThis card is bonkers.",

I think the others would be Power 9 even if you bumped all their mana costs up by exactly 1. Would Timetwister be P9 at 3U? at 2UU? Maybe. Maybe not.<br /><br />To appease Timetwister fans, I will close by making it clear that because it Is costed at merely 2U, it's ridiculously stupidly amazing and it's definitely Power 9 material.",

Instead, I'm trying to say, 'the basic effect of this card has been proven to be the weakest of the Power 9 effects, and I believe that most of Timetwister's power comes from its undercostedness, and I FURTHER suggest that this is NOT the case with the other Power 9, since their abilities have been put on heavier costing cards and have STILL been some of the most powerful cards in the game- ESPECIALLY Brainstorm and Lotus Petal.\nIf this sounds wrong to you, please explain to me why Time Reversal is so much weaker than the other 'Fixed Power' cards. I think the others would be Power 9 even if you bumped all their mana costs up by exactly 1. Would Timetwister be P9 at 3U? at 2UU? Maybe. Maybe not.\n\nTo appease Timetwister fans, I will close by making it clear that because it Is costed at merely 2U, it's ridiculously stupidly amazing and it's definitely Power 9 material.",

It makes sense: wood spirits flitting between the trees unseen, raising their arms branch-like if anyone glances their way, invisibly approaching the enemy.

Thus, for Shanodin Dryads, we're left with the artwork and not much else outside of a forest/nature theme deck.\n\nAlternatives, for those inclined: \n[autocard]Somberwald Dryad[/autocard], the 2/2 upgrade of this very card. \n[autocard]Wormwood Dryad[/autocard], for those who dabble in the darker arts and want to maximize their dryad-based damage.  \n[autocard]Yavimaya Dryad[/autocard], the most fun dryad of all, in my humble opinion, which serves to either lead you to new leafy domains, or sneak into the enemy's.",
