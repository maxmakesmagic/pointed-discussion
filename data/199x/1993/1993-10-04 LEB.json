You wanna play that [autocard]Phyrexian Obliterator[/autocard], but you have a [autocard]Swamp[/autocard], [autocard]Island[/autocard], [autocard]Plains[/autocard], [autocard]Forest[/autocard], [autocard]Mountain[/autocard], the Obliterator, and this in your hand? Go ahead, hell do it TURN 1. Madness. This is worth AT LEAST 1k. BUT, I do think it is overpriced, as I would never pay more than 60$ for a card, and $3000 for a card restricted in Vintage? Meaning I have to buy 55 other $100+ cards? No thanks, I'll pass.\nFinal: 50/5. The. Best. Card. In. The. Game. With the possible exceptions of Ancestral Recall or (I'm gonna say it, don't hurt me please) [autocard]Jace, the Mind Sculptor[/autocard], SOLELY because if you had a deck with only land and Lotuses/Recalls it would suck but a deck with only lands and Jace could at least survive a bit longer.",

   "text_posted": "\"[i]Is it just me or is that Oracle text way more confusing than it needs to be?[/i]\"\n\n@lica_barelli: The second ability [i]does[/i] sound really complicated at first, but i think there's no way to make the Oracle wording much simpler. In such peculiar cases, Alpha's common language might still help as reminder text, but just won't do it for such an elaborate game anymore because it's not distinct enough once there are card interactions.\n\nIt still does basically exactly what was originally inteded with \" [i]If Cyclopean Tomb is destroyed, remove one token of your choice each upkeep, returning that land to its original nature.[/i]\"\nI'm [i]pretty[/i] sure back then they didn't plan that you could still [autocard]Stifle[/autocard] this ability, say, twenty turns after it went to the graveyard (long after it could remove any more mire counters), though :D\n\nThis ability is very uncommon or at least something you wouln't find on newer cards of this sort (that change particular array of permanents in some way) anymore. Instead of just 'disenchanting' all permanents that were influenced by it when it at once gets destroyed (e.g. like [autocard]Corrosion[/autocard] - which again is a pretty old card by itself).\nYet Cyclopean Tomb slowly 'renaturalizes' only one each turn, which is the main reason for the confusing wording you need now in order to go with the rules that have become far more complex since Alpha.\n\nThe part with \"[i]remove all mire counters from a land that a mire counter was put onto with Cyclopean Tomb but that a mire counter has not been removed from with Cyclopean Tomb.[/i]\" is just making sure you can't pick a land during your upkeep that you already picked and doesn't have any counters left so by choosing it you could make sure other lands keep their mire counters forever.",

Obviously needs to be run against the right deck and it won't work against most, but man, being able to counter black spells (not as necessary with all the shroud/troll shroud in green, but kill spells are anathema to many mono green decks) repeatedly as long as you have a few spare mana is crazy!  I can actually see sideboarding 2-3 of these for casual games depending on your playgroup or running a few in some legacy environments.  You're not going to use it that often, but it can just wreck some of green's strongest counters.",
