That title goes to Emrakul, who has haste (via extra turn), Flying, proxies himself (via extra turn), untaps all lands you control (via extra turn), is uncounterable and can be killed by almost nothing. The fact that one hit from him makes you sacrifice 6 permanents really never makes a difference in the game since that's usually enought to finish you.\n\nThis guy dies to every type of removal, is nearly impossible to play, requires a second cost to get out, and can still be chump-blocked by anything with deathtouch. The fact that he costs 15 of one color means that there's a very small chance of ever giving him useful abilities like trample and haste too.",
