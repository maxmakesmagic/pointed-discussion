So many cards rely on tapping, or untapping, and many powerful cards make untapping impossible, or difficult, to balance said power. But what about overcoming the cost of tapping or untapping? When I find a wonderful card like this, I see how it detracts from my deck, and I compensate for it. In this card's case, I must discard a card. First I want to find a way where discarding is not an issue, second, I want to find a way to replenish my cards to continue discarding, and finally, find a way to exploit this to my advantage over my current opponent. Making card discard not an issue is easy enough, good old <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library of Leng\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Library of Leng\">Library of Leng</a> takes care of that. Now for the fun part, figuring out a way to get steady card draw, as well as exploiting the ability to untap all day long! The quickest way for card draw is one card, or a card like it, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanis the Omnipotent\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Arcanis the Omnipotent\">Arcanis the Omnipotent</a> . Let's draw three cards, then discard one to untap, and repeat the process as much as we like, oh let's hope we have Library of Leng out! Nice, infinite card draw, but why stop there? Let's do the card draw AND do some damage to our opponent! <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving Magpie\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Thieving Magpie\">Thieving Magpie</a> works nicely with a<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermetic Study\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Hermetic Study\">Hermetic Study</a> slapped on, or a<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal Sorcerer\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Prodigal Sorcerer\">Prodigal Sorcerer</a> ,or any of that cards clones with similar ability, with a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curiosity\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Curiosity\">Curiosity</a> slapped on. Now we are tapping to do a point of direct damage, discarding a card to the top of our library with Library of Leng out, to untap with Mind Over Matter , right after resolving drawing a card, do do it all over again, as much as we like. Infinite Damage Combo!!! Okay so many different ways to break that multi-card combo up. But we are playing blue people, and should have some form of countering available! As for permanents, MOM should have no problem tapping whatever is causing you distress:) Time to execute is a factor though. And though this is the beginning of a very powerful combo, so many other decks will break it up in 10 or fewer turns. One option is building a smaller 60 card deck. Four <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza's Bauble\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Urza's Bauble\">Urza's Bauble</a> , four <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra's Bauble\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mishra's Bauble\">Mishra's Bauble</a> and four <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresight\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Foresight\">Foresight</a> and any similar cards to slim the deck fast. But I prefer the more devious way, and would splash some green. Why stop at infinite card draw and damage? Let's go Infinite Life Combo!!! With good old <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Aluren\">Aluren</a> , you just need an <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence Warden\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Essence Warden\">Essence Warden</a> out, or a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradise Plume\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Paradise Plume\">Paradise Plume</a> out(choose blue!).  You then proceed to play<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Man-o'-war\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Man-o'-war\">Man-o'-war</a> . Then you play the other one in your hand for free , targeting the first. Repeat as much as you like for as much life as you like:) You may use any number of green spells to populate your hand with Man-o'-war. You also use any number of green spells for mana sources or land fetching . Any number of blue for card draw, and since you are using these colors, don't forget some <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coiling Oracle\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Coiling Oracle\">Coiling Oracle</a> and maybe a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recycle\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Recycle\">Recycle</a> for more infinite card draw!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />",

If it said exile instead of discard would be a bunch more fair and actually be used as the card was intended. Even though it still would be crazy with exile, at least you couldnt abuse the graveyard with it as well.\n\n\n@Recurring Memories\nCards like this are what make magic Pay 2 Win and One Sided. ",

Magic: The Gathering is a <b>Trading Card Game</b> (TCG), so it requires some amount of monetary investment to even play the game, which, in most contexts, is required to win in the first place.  This is a property of all commercially produced games, though TCG's often require sustained investment, rather than a lump sum up front like a non-subs_cription video game or a board game.  Hence, the phrase &quot;Pay to Win,&quot; is only vacuously true unless you are advocating playing with borrowed, stolen, or counterfeit cards.  That being said, if you are dissatisfied with the product, that is your opinion and completely valid, but you (again, hopefully) knew that TCG's have an entrance fee:  the cards themselves.
