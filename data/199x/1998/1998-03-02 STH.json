   "text_posted": "I disagree that it would work with kiln fiend, because as an additional cost to casting fling, you have to sacrifice a creature, so you can't cast fling until its full cost is paid for.\n\nanyhoo, i guess you could put two bolts on someones head then fling a kiln fiend for the win.\n\nI hope this does come out in M11, because i think it will make thought gouger.  Bloodghast, Reassembling skeleton for hand fodder, and if he gets killed before you get fling, then you get to draw a new hand.

   "text_parsed": "It's not really a double-edged sword, statistically speaking (with some fringe exceptions... more on that later*).<br /><br />It's true that sometimes you really want to see card X (or more likely, card X or card Y or card Z), and Mulch forces you to discard it.  Well, that sucks.  But played out over enough games, you'll be just as likely for Mulch to get card X/Y/Z out faster as you are to have it take longer.  It doesn't always <i>seem</i> that way, because it's a lot easier to notice when Mulch discards the card you needed than it is to notice that Mulch got you four cards closer to the card you needed.  Average out how much it's slowed you down by passing a key card vs. how many times it's gotten you one sooner, and it will almost always come out to 50/50 or thereabouts.  (Same is true for being milled, but that doesn't stop people who don't quite get it from saying it's overpowered because it can get rid of your good cards.)<br /><br />Now, that's not enough to warrant paying {1}{G} at sorcery speed.  But of course that's not all the card does.  It may end up putting all four cards in your graveyard, in which case you get card disadvantage of one, but it may also replicate itself, or give up to card advantage of three.<br /><br />A card advantage range of -1 to +3 is a risky proposal at this cost, so you need to be careful.  But, if your deck has any way of using your graveyard as a resource, this is a grand slam.  Dredge loves this card.  Threshold loves this card.  Reanimator loves this card.  Flashback loves this card.  Basically, if you can spare a few slots and a couple dual-lands, any graveyard-centric deck will be better with Mulch than without it.  This is because if it doesn't give you straight card advantage, it's giving you <i>virtual card advantage</i>, meaning while you don't have extra cards in your hand or on your board, you have more toys to play with either by effectively tutoring with Reanimate/Dredge, by powering up your Threshold cards, or by casting from your graveyard with Flashback.<br /><br />So that's a long way of saying this: Mulch isn't a 3.7-star card.  It's obviously not going in every deck that runs green, but if you run any graveyard mechanic, it's a grand slam on many levels.  Sure, in Innistrad it's going to have to compete with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think Twice\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Think Twice\">Think Twice</a> and the new <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate Ravings\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Desperate Ravings\">Desperate Ravings</a>, but for decks that don't run Red or Blue it's a stellar enabler.  And RUG decks could easily run all three in varying amounts depending on the focus of the deck.<br /><br /><br />*There <b>ARE</b> some decks where you clearly will <i>not</i> want this card even if you have some graveyard shenanigans going on.  Most notably in the current meta is in <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing Pod\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Birthing Pod\">Birthing Pod</a> decks.  The deck thrives on being able to select the right creature at the right time and being able to properly ramp up to each consecutive CMC.

The elf has <i>tons</i> of personality: he is hopeful for a better future, stoic in the face of the terrible present, and committed to his purpose. Two-dimensionally, his gaze points toward the hellish skies over the Stronghold, but three-dimensionally, he is looking to some point off-frame and in front of the plane of the foreground. He confronts his situation, but is looking forward, to a better tomorrow--a tomorrow he is going to help make happen, alone if necessary--the sense of isolation in the image is great. He pulls on his bowstring, ready to act...<br /><br />Mechanically, the card is a decent enough one-drop 1/1. Might interdict an opponent from playing a one-drop of their own if they're only holding one-toughness fliers. The choice of -1/-1 instead of damage is interesting. This archer's arrows hinder their target's ability to act, even as they wound. Very appropriate for the insurgent elves of Rath. Besieged guerrillas must not only attack, but also impair their opponents. Desperation is a mother of innovation.<br /><br />Magnificent card.

The colors are mindblowing: while the whole piece is done in earth tones, note the subtle distinction of the elf, clad in very \"living\" colors, with the sickly tones of the environment. The elf has [i]tons[/i] of personality: he is hopeful for a better future, stoic in the face of the terrible present, and committed to his purpose. Two-dimensionally, his gaze points toward the hellish skies over the Stronghold, but three-dimensionally, he is looking to some point off-frame and in front of the plane of the foreground. He confronts his situation, but is looking forward, to a better tomorrow--a tomorrow he is going to help make happen, alone if necessary--the sense of isolation in the image is great. He pulls on his bowstring, ready to act...\n\nMechanically, the card is a decent enough one-drop 1/1. Might interdict an opponent from playing a one-drop of their own if they're only holding one-toughness fliers. The choice of -1/-1 instead of damage is interesting. This archer's arrows hinder their target's ability to act, even as they wound. Very appropriate for the insurgent elves of Rath. Besieged guerrillas must not only attack, but also impair their opponents. Desperation is a mother of innovation.\n\nMagnificent card. Sits alongside [autocard]Cat Burglar[/autocard] in terms of art quality and flavor/mechanics unity.",

   "text_posted": "When i look at Spitting Hydra's artwork, i wonder why the ability costs a +1/+1 counter to activate:\nIn Magic, +1/+1 counters on a hydra usually represent one head each.\nSo when you activate the ability to allow the hydra to spit, one head apparently dies in the process.\nYet the head on the artwork doesn't look like the 'regurgitated' acid would have corroded its throat.\n\n@scúmbling1: I wouldn't compare [autocard]Arc Slogger[/autocard] to the hydra, but there are similarities to [autocard]Siege-Gang Commander[/autocard].\n\nSpitting Hyra and Siege-Gang Commander both enter as big body for [3RR] (the latter divided into a 2/2 and three 1/1s) who can deal damage for [1R] and at the cost of shrinking the body [i](removing a counter / saccing a goblin)[/i]. When they get [autocard]flicker[/autocard]ed or bounced, they are set back to their original strenth and their abilities can be used again.\n\nArc Slogger might have a big body for [3RR], but his ability works different: it allows multiple [autocard]Shock[/autocard]s for a very low amount of mana without decreasing the slogger's strength, but which can only be used several times per game.\n\nSo i agree with AmericanVigor - the idea behind this creature was nice, and despite its rather weak execution, it's nice to see Wizards trying to retry this concept on another card (with success, which is worth mentioning as well, since you know this isn't the only concept that got \"a second chance\" - especially when fixing from the other side of the power level - [autocard multiverseid=\"5629\"]sometimes[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"23054\"]it kind of works[/autocard], but [autocard multiverseid=\"2478\"]sometimes[/autocard] it [autocard multiverseid=\"15193\"]still goes wrong[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"729\"]even in[/autocard] [autocard multiverseid=\"10423\"]the second try[/autocard].",
