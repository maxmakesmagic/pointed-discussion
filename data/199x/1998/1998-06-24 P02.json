This girl is always out of Bolt range, but her power still grows/decreases, which is what I'm mainly after. She does lack Flying, though. Or any form of evasion. But considering EDH, I'm pretty glad this card exists. Nightmare, Korlash, and this... who doesn't like three creatures that get buffed from Swamps? More things to benefit from my Liliana of the Dark Realms, if she survives! Both cards are better in different situations, but I find both to be quite solid, and worth a spot in some decks.",

In limited, I might put it in as one of my last few cards, but it seems scary to run two. Although I suppose a deck with four or five could just be brutal. There just seems to be a huge disparity between when it lets you get a huge amount of reach in a game you might have lost, versus when it is completely irrelevant and you just wish you could have had a [autocard]Wind Drake[/autocard] or something.\n\nAlso, I don't usually like the silly flavor text red cards many times get, but the, \"Catch!\" line on many versions of this card is just miles better than any other crap they wrote on the other printings.",
