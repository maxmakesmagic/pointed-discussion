In order to use it properly you have to do something before in the same turn, since it can't trace previous damages... So it reflect the \"act now\" philosophy of red!

Let your jibsheets fall,\nAnd you'll put your boats to sea,\nAnd you'll put your boats to sea.\n\nThe harpoon struck and the line played out,\nWith a single flourish of his tail,\nHe capsized the boat and we lost five men,\nAnd we did not catch that whale,\nAnd we did not catch that whale.\n\nThe losing of those five jolly men,\nIt grieved the captain sore,\nBut the losing of that fine whalefish\nNow it grieved him ten times more,\nNow it grieved him ten times more.\n\nOh Greenland is a barren land\nA land that bears no green\nWhere there's ice and snow, and the whalefishes blow\nAnd the daylight's seldom seen,\nAnd the daylight's seldom seen.\n\n\nFelt such a cool card deserved an epic sea shanty. Yeah, Splinter Twin. I was thinking suspend via Jhoira, but S. Twin's a way better idea.",

   "text_parsed": "Here's what's going on.  Black needs haste for purposes of limited.  Black is very restricted in creature keywords and to make sure there is diversity in commons and uncommon black creatures, black needs haste.  Green needs haste for constructed.  There are many things that development needs green creatures to do for constructed that haste helps.  The compromise reached was to make haste a secondary ability in black allowing it to be more frequent and lower rarity.

   "text_posted": "Here's what's going on.  Black needs haste for purposes of limited.  Black is very restricted in creature keywords and to make sure there is diversity in commons and uncommon black creatures, black needs haste.  Green needs haste for constructed.  There are many things that development needs green creatures to do for constructed that haste helps.  The compromise reached was to make haste a secondary ability in black allowing it to be more frequent and lower rarity.

If exactly one creature is blocking it, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If two or more creatures are blocking it, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage assignment order announced for it. This may allow the blocked creature to divide its combat damage.

When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt.

Milling out decks that have an Eldrazi Titan in their deck (which everyone worried about mill should have, at least in sideboard). Here's how it works:\r<br />1. Play Path to Exile on one of your opponent's creatures. Let this spell resolve. \r<br />2. Play Archive Trap (for free). \r<br />3. If the Eldrazi Titan is milled, then the trigger goes on the stack, at which point you respond by putting Stroke of Genius for 1 targetting your opponent, and then respond to your own spell by playing the rest of your Archive Traps. You do not want that trigger to resolve!  \r<br />4.

Milling out decks that have an Eldrazi Titan in their deck (which everyone worried about mill should have, at least in sideboard). Here's how it works:\r\n1. Play Path to Exile on one of your opponent's creatures. Let this spell resolve. \r\n2. Play Archive Trap (for free). \r\n3. If the Eldrazi Titan is milled, then the trigger goes on the stack, at which point you respond by putting Stroke of Genius for 1 targetting your opponent, and then respond to your own spell by playing the rest of your Archive Traps. You do not want that trigger to resolve!  \r\n4.

If the effect is bad (e.g. [autocard]Smokestack[/autocard], [autocard]Bottomless Pit[/autocard], [autocard]Mana Vortex[/autocard]), phase it in on your turn after its effect would trigger; if the effect is good (e.g. [autocard]Font of Mythos[/autocard], [autocard]Shizuko, Caller of Autumn[/autocard], [autocard]Wild Evocation[/autocard]), phase it in on your last opponent's turn after its effect would normally trigger.",

I also included a way to keep it alive for as long as you can. You could use [autocard]Zombie Infestation[/autocard], [autocard]Breeding Pit[/autocard], [autocard]Coffin Queen[/autocard], [autocard]Geth, Lord of the Vault[/autocard]... a lot of things can keep Contamination alive. \n\nJust watch out: with some cards like this and [autocard]Oppression[/autocard], people will not like playing with you, and a game of Magic could quickly turn from fun to unpleasant.",

Legendary creatures on the other hand are one of a kind.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the rules text on planeswalkers uses gendered pronouns, for example the use of &quot;him&quot; on <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk Relentless\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Garruk Relentless\">Garruk Relentless</a>. Maybe now that they're heavily pushing a format where legendary creatures are significant they'll consider doing this with legends too.<br /><br />Also, notice how the ability on this card (as printed) says &quot;Add <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" />&quot; but the ability as printed on <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rofellos, Llanowar Emissary\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Rofellos, Llanowar Emissary\">Rofellos, Llanowar Emissary</a> in the same block says &quot;add one green mana.&quot;",

   "text_parsed": "for those that do not understand what the card means by &quot;can only be countered by spells or abilities&quot;<br /><br />the actual term counter refers to a few select situations where a card is nullified. A second way to &quot;counter&quot; a card, is to remove the target of the said card. For example, if you attempt to cast giant growth, targeting a creature you control and in response to you targeting a card with your spell on the stack, I can remove the said target with a spell that I will place on the stack (can be anything from boomerang to terror). The stack will now begin to resolve. My spell resolves and removes your creature (be it temporarily or permanently) then when your spell (giant growth) attempts to resolve, the target is no longer valid and the spell is, in according to the rules and mechanics of the game, countered.<br /><br />This card by-passes this rule. Why? because you can place the trigger of swapping your card for their card on to the stack and return YOUR creature back to your hand. Normally, because if one of the targets of a multi target, non-&quot;up to&quot; spell (see note at end for further detail) is removed from the field, the spell is countered. In this case, you can do clever tricks such as casting this spell and after targets are declared, you can turn to mist your creature before the spell begins to resolve to invalidate your creature as a target, thus receiving the opposing monster for the rest of the game.<br /><br /><br />Note regarding multi target invalidation with and without the key phrase &quot;up to&quot;<br />(for example, a spell that can buff up to 4 targets with +1/+1 and one of the targets is removed. This will not counter the card because of the key phrase &quot;up to&quot;. If you we're to place turn to mist on the stack after your opponent selects your creature and their creature for a card such as peel from reality, the creature they selected will not be returned to their hand and neither will yours, since one target has become invalid)<br /><br /><br /><br />If I got any of that wrong, please feel free to elaborate. To my knowledge, this is the mechanic of countering a card by invalidating it's target (go read the card guile and it may perk some interesting ideas)",

My spell resolves and removes your creature (be it temporarily or permanently) then when your spell (giant growth) attempts to resolve, the target is no longer valid and the spell is, in according to the rules and mechanics of the game, countered.\n\nThis card by-passes this rule. Why? because you can place the trigger of swapping your card for their card on to the stack and return YOUR creature back to your hand. Normally, because if one of the targets of a multi target, non-\"up to\" spell (see note at end for further detail) is removed from the field, the spell is countered. In this case, you can do clever tricks such as casting this spell and after targets are declared, you can turn to mist your creature before the spell begins to resolve to invalidate your creature as a target, thus receiving the opposing monster for the rest of the game.\n\n\nNote regarding multi target invalidation with and without the key phrase \"up to\"\n(for example, a spell that can buff up to 4 targets with +1/+1 and one of the targets is removed. This will not counter the card because of the key phrase \"up to\". If you we're to place turn to mist on the stack after your opponent selects your creature and their creature for a card such as peel from reality, the creature they selected will not be returned to their hand and neither will yours, since one target has become invalid)\n\n\n\nIf I got any of that wrong, please feel free to elaborate. To my knowledge, this is the mechanic of countering a card by invalidating it's target (go read the card guile and it may perk some interesting ideas)",
