Exile and Destroy are not just interchangeable, and the things affected should go to the graveyard. If I wanted to design something that blew a hole in TIME, I'd probably make it exile. This merely causes great physical energies to be released. Definitely a 'destroy' effect.\ne) Destroying cards from a setting is...interesting- but too narrow a 'search' and the card is just weak.\nFurther, *nearly* all the Truly Dangerous and Ancient Artifacts of Power come from the before-time, before 8th Edition. SO I am also really liking the flavor of 'This kills every troublesome thing from Mox Sapphire to the Mirari' :)\nf) and lastly, I made it a filter-mana stone, because this is how Urza learned sorcery, and this ability suddenly makes it MUCH more interesting on a number of levels than any comparable artifact. This thing is pretty wierd, but I think not really broken, and definitely not useless. :D",
