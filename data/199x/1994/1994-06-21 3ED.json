   "text_posted": "[b]Aaron’s Random Card Comment of the Day #54, 1/10/10[/b]\r\n\r\nThis very printing of Meekstone was the first card to awaken my inner Johnny oh-so-many years ago. I went out at bought/traded for four [autocard]Savannah Lions[/autocard], four Meekstones, and four [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard]s, threw in the [autocard]Kismet[/autocard]s I had, and fleshed it out with other small creatures, [autocard]Swords to Plowshares[/autocard], and [autocard]Disenchant[/autocard]. I even had a couple [autocard]Holy Strength[/autocard]s that could either go on my Serras or be used to lock down opposing 2-power guys with Meekstone. In my primitive playgroup, it was pretty annoying.

   "text_parsed": "Ante DOES still exist.... How is it tht people realize that people do in fact still play for Ante? At my House, we still do sometimes because it's fun. This game was originally played for Ante, and in Revised, there was a Rule Book that came with every Starter Deck, and inside, it had a &quot;House Rules&quot; section, which, showed very common House Rules people used, and one of them was that you didn't have to play for Ante because back then it was REQUIRED. Every game was for Ante.\r<br />\r<br />Another common House Rule, was a Mulligan. Today that's a standard rule you can use even in a tournament, but back then you couldn't because it was only a House Rule.\r<br />\r<br />Also this card is NOT more powerful than Ancestral Recall. I've been playing this game for 16 years now, and I can tell you that one Black Mana is NOT always worth drawing that many cards, you'll deck yourself. Ancestral Recall is worth a crap load of money because it's the best draw spell in the game. This card isn't nearly as good because you have Ante MORE crap. If you don't win you lose not only the game but TWO cards.\r<br />\r<br />To the guy who said &quot;If Ante was still around this would be an Auto Include in every deck&quot;.... No, you're wrong. I was there when Ante was not only common, but you HAD to play for ante. I don't think some of you realize that those little Rule Books that came with EVERY Starter Deck back in Revised, flat out said you play for Ante. You didn't get to say no unless BOTH players agreed not to.\r<br />\r<br />I realize that today it's the reverse and you have to actually ask if they wanna play for Ante, but back then Ante was REQUIRED to play Magic, and you HAD to Ante a card up. Also, you didn't always turn over the top card, there was Ante where you and the person you played against would CHOOSE a card from your collection, and THAT was the Ante. Also, you could use money too. I used to play for like 5 dollars, or, flip the top card over after a Shuffle, or, you went into your deck and both chose a card you were willing to Ante, or, you could even Ante up a card you chose and the other person did to of equal value.\r<br />\r<br />Sometimes we would also just buy a Booster or Starter Deck, and use THAT as the Ante. Like for example, you'd buy two boosters or Revised, or, a Revised Starter Deck, or a Booster of Antiquities, or Legends, and then your opponent did the same, and whoever won, got to keep the Boosters or Starter Decks.\r<br />\r<br />Another House Rule back then was Pizza Ante; Basically whoever lost had to Ante up 5 - 10 dollars towards the Pizza for everyone else. This was usually on a Friday night where everyone was playing at someone's house (I used to host games every week back then) so everyone would come to where I lived, we would all go inside my Mom's Camper, and play Magic all night long, and when the sun came up, got Breakfast and kept going. Whoever lost had to either go get Pizza, or just pay for some of it, like I said, it was common to Ante up 5 or 10 dollars towards the Pizza Bill, and when we got older, Beer money.",

It can't just be that they simply enjoy other methods of play, depending on the situation (possibly including Ante, when consented to by all players), because there is only one right way to play the game, and that's your way. And only wusses would ever mulligan, or let an opponent mulligan, because the only acceptable way to play this game of strategy is to gamble on the games, and then allow chance to skew the results to an irrecoverable degree. Anyone who has any opinion other than this single view is clearly inferior.<br /><br />While we're at it, lets do away with those silly ban lists, restricted lists, the increased minimum deck size, and most certainly that four-copies-per-card limit. Constructed deck restrictions aren't what Magic is about, after all, and that surely holds true even with modern cards, because the game hasn't massively changed over the years at all, right? If my opponent can't beat my deck of 40 copies of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor of the Dross\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Chancellor of the Dross\">Chancellor of the Dross</a>, then they deserve to lose on turn zero and lose a card permanently, to boot.<br /><br />And what's with all these different formats, and card rotating out, huh? Eighteen years ago, no cards had rotated out, and that's the way this game should stay forever, no exceptions. All cards ever printed should be usable in all contexts, and there should never be divergent rules systems that must be balanced in distinct ways, often by disallowing certain cards or altering fundamental rules of the game. The only thing that these different formats do is give new players the impression that there are numerous acceptable ways to play this game, all of which can be enjoyable in different ways, for different reasons. We don't want them getting that wrong idea stuck in their heads. Then they might even commit that most atrocious crime of failing to be informed on an outmoded rule referenced by very few cards, and done away with in the earliest days of this game, from before when many of the newest generation of players could form whole sentences.<br /><br />Good job, you've successfully changed the mind of a random stranger on the internet by ranting about their inferiority due to having tastes that differ from yours, and now that person is just as closed-minded and bigoted over a card game as you are. Don't you feel oh so very satisfied?<br /><i>{/sarcastictrollrant}</i><br /><br />Your true friend and convert, <br />Summer Glau",

Anyone who has any opinion other than this single view is clearly inferior.\n\nWhile we're at it, lets do away with those silly ban lists, restricted lists, the increased minimum deck size, and most certainly that four-copies-per-card limit. Constructed deck restrictions aren't what Magic is about, after all, and that surely holds true even with modern cards, because the game hasn't massively changed over the years at all, right? If my opponent can't beat my deck of 40 copies of [autocard]Chancellor of the Dross[/autocard], then they deserve to lose on turn zero and lose a card permanently, to boot.\n\nAnd what's with all these different formats, and card rotating out, huh? Eighteen years ago, no cards had rotated out, and that's the way this game should stay forever, no exceptions. All cards ever printed should be usable in all contexts, and there should never be divergent rules systems that must be balanced in distinct ways, often by disallowing certain cards or altering fundamental rules of the game. The only thing that these different formats do is give new players the impression that there are numerous acceptable ways to play this game, all of which can be enjoyable in different ways, for different reasons. We don't want them getting that wrong idea stuck in their heads. Then they might even commit that most atrocious crime of failing to be informed on an outmoded rule referenced by very few cards, and done away with in the earliest days of this game, from before when many of the newest generation of players could form whole sentences.\n\nGood job, you've successfully changed the mind of a random stranger on the internet by ranting about their inferiority due to having tastes that differ from yours, and now that person is just as closed-minded and bigoted over a card game as you are. Don't you feel oh so very satisfied?\n[i]{/sarcastictrollrant}[/i]\n\nYour true friend and convert, \nSummer Glau",

   "text_posted": "This is the only fair ante card (in terms of ante, not effect), and should have been the model other ante cards followed.  The problem with every other ante card is it just screws over your opponent by either trading ownership with an opponent's card ([autocard]Darkpact[/autocard]), letting you take back your ante ([autocard]Jeweled Bird[/autocard]), or just making the opponent lose another card to ante ([autocard]Demonic Attorney[/autocard]).\n\nThis represents the best form of ante, and shows what Black is best at: great power at any cost.

Wow am I sick of morons who know nothing about the History of this game talking like they know a thing, which they don't, saying you can't Concede....\r<br />\r<br />For the people who seem to know NOTHING:\r<br />\r<br />Ante works by making people actually play for something other than boredom, and gives people who can't afford good cards a chance to win one. However, if you are about to lose your card from Ante, you can, at ANY time, during ANY match, simply Concede, and take your crap and leave.\r<br />\r<br />When you play for Ante, you can ALWAYS concede and not lose that card.

PLEASE remember that....\r<br />\r<br />So, let's take a minute to remember:\r<br />\r<br />1. Playing for Ante back in 1993 and 1994 was REQUIRED. You could not &quot;NOT&quot; play for Ante. The only time you could decide not to was if you and your opponent BOTH agreed not to play for Ante. Those were considered Casual Games.\r<br />\r<br />House Rules said you could instead PICK cards to put in the Ante. You could ALSO Ante Boosters and Starter Decks or even Money. I've done all three.\r<br />\r<br />If you started a game for Ante, and you saw the card you had to Ante, and didn't want to lose it, you were always OK to say &quot;I can't lose this card, I'm going to concede&quot; and just stop playing. You could ALWAYS do that. I have like 10 Rule Books from everything from Unlimited Starter Decks to Revised and even 4th and 5th Edition, which taught you how to play. You could simply concede at ANY time, and not lose your cards. Just the game.\r<br />\r<br />If you lost a card to Ante, it was common courtesy to offer to trade that card back for something else.\r<br />\r<br />But not once were you required to lose your cards if you were not OK with it. I can't remember which card it is, but basically, it says &quot;If the opponent does NOT concede, you exchange ownership of this and that card, this exchange is permanent&quot;.... You could just concede and keep your card.",
   "text_posted": "To the moron who said they can't even Concede.... YES YOU CAN! Wow am I sick of morons who know nothing about the History of this game talking like they know a thing, which they don't, saying you can't Concede....\r\n\r\nFor the people who seem to know NOTHING:\r\n\r\nAnte works by making people actually play for something other than boredom, and gives people who can't afford good cards a chance to win one. However, if you are about to lose your card from Ante, you can, at ANY time, during ANY match, simply Concede, and take your crap and leave.\r\n\r\nWhen you play for Ante, you can ALWAYS concede and not lose that card. In fact some cards that are Ante cards, actually SAY right ON the card, that the opponent may concede instead of losing their card.

From reading your posts, I believe there are many here who are far more practiced at the accounting of mana costs, for the greatest efficiency in deck design.  While I do find that aspect of the game rather challenging,  I would offer my observations based on a particular style of deck, as well as the specific deck that I have constructed, in that style.  One of my favorite, and long standing designs, is a &quot;Necromancer&quot; deck.  It contains many ways to throw things (HUGE THINGS  TERRIBLE THINGS, WITH UNSEEMLY MANA COSTS!!), into my graveyard, and bring them out again, at a fraction of the cost to &quot;hard cast&quot; them.  After a turn or two of tearing my opponents to shreds, I find that my reanimated minion becomes fatigued, and so I Sacrifice it, to play two or three more spells, bringing onto the field at least two creatures that are just as incredibly dangerous and costly, while still having a little mana left over to fling a Doomblade.  Under these very specific circumstances, this spell is extremely effective, and I recommend it most highly.  Also, as it is an interrupt, if you have a Pestilence in play (or similar pumpable ability/power), than you can even hold off on using the spell until combat, and then, depending on your opponent's strategy and spells, you may have the opportunity to Sacrifice a creature who was already going to die, and do no damage to your opponent, and turn them into fuel for a dangerous activiated ability of your choosing.  Thank you for your attention.  :-)",

The real problem with Jump isn't that it isn't useful.  It's that it's blue.  Most of blue's most useful creatures all ready fly.  In a multi-colored blue and green deck, Jump becomes much better.",

   "text_posted": "This was the only card my uncle was missing from the Revised set, and he offered to trade a [autocard]Shivan Dragon[/autocard] to me or my friends if we managed to \"pick the rose\" from one of our booster packs.  My brother's friend Gregg drew the lucky straw the next week when we all took a trip down to the local Comic Book Store to get a few packs each, and so, because of Mana Short and a trade, he became the first of our little playgroup to own the mighty Shivan Dragon.\n\nNone of us at the time had any idea how good Mana Short itself actually was.  Even without [autocard]Stasis[/autocard] or [autocard]Winter Orb[/autocard], this could cripple an opponent's tempo.  Cast during your opponent's upkeep, and they probably wouldn't be able to play any spells until their next turn.",

I loved that even moderately powerful cards used to have drawbacks that required more skill to play than just throwing down an endless supply of awesome creatures and attacking.",
