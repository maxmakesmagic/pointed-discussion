   "text_posted": "Wow, the people complaining about this card have obviously never played EDH. For 3 mana, you can instantly douse any Voltron deck, or where commanders need to tap to use abilities, and at the very least, hamper any EDH deck's plans. [autocard]Krenko, Mob Boss[/autocard]? [autocard]Heartless Hidetsugu[/autocard]? [autocard]Jaya Ballard, Task Mage[/autocard]? [autocard]Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker[/autocard]? [autocard]Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind[/autocard]? [autocard]Marrow-Gnawer[/autocard]? [autocard]Visara the Dreadful[/autocard]? [autocard]Zirilan of the Claw[/autocard]? Need I share more generals that you can completely douse?\n\nTake general damage winning out of the question. Put it in a lifegain deck, and your opponent has got to mill you. Then chuck in a Elixir of immortality and laugh in their face. Don't forget to chuck in a Darksteel Forge to keep your Arena around, mind you. Then they've got to exile it.\n\nAnd what about your own general? It's an artifact, so it'll fit in any deck. Tap your opponent's generals, then play your own. If they're not affected by tapping, all the better! [autocard]Geth, Lord of the Vault[/autocard], [autocard]Grimgrin, Corpse-Born[/autocard], [autocard]Memnarch[/autocard], [autocard]Oona, Queen of the Fae[/autocard], [autocard]Sliver Queen[/autocard], [autocard]Zedruu the Greathearted[/autocard].

I have 1 of each printing, and yes the chronicles printing does have the antiquities anvil instead of the Legends pillar. \n\nI think that the part about not being effected by effects that only target walls is supposed to be a drawback because it can't be targeted by the glyph cycle in Legends. On the other hand, it is protected from [autocard]tunnel[/autocard], and can safely block [autocard]battering ram[/autocard] from antiquities.\n\nHere is the glyph cycle:\nWhite: [autocard]Glyph of Life[/autocard]\nBlue: [autocard]Glyph of Delusion[/autocard]\nBlack: [autocard]Glyph of Doom[/autocard]\nRed: [autocard]Glyph of Destruction[/autocard]\nGreen: [autocard]Glyph of Reincarnation[/autocard]\n\nGreat, old card that has, in my opinion, survived the test of time.\n\nSalient: [autocard]Wall of diffusion[/autocard] does the shadow blocking.

Meanwhile, use <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=march of the machines\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"march of the machines\">march of the machines</a> and your <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=myr landshaper\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"myr landshaper\">myr landshaper</a>s to eliminate their land. <br /><br />If all else fails, tap the four, sacrifice your <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar Druid\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Llanowar Druid\">Llanowar Druid</a> (can be replaced by early harvest) to untap your forests and then sacrifice them all. This combo kinda works in a red/green beat down with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki Raider\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Akki Raider\">Akki Raider</a>. You get a 4/4 and a 4/1 until end of turn. Of course, it would be nice to have a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=crucible of worlds\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"crucible of worlds\">crucible of worlds</a>, but there are other ways to get lands out of your graveyard. Then, there's always <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=terravore\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"terravore\">terravore</a>.<br /><br />None of these may be the best combo's in magic (they all require at least three cards and too much mana), but if you're playing a wood elemental, you're obviously not playing at tournament level. <br /><br />Your comment Albino more makes me long for the olden days of magic before &quot;meta decks&quot; when players used a little thing like creativity to create decks to play for FUN.  Having returned to magic from a long absence, I'm a disappointed  to see the creativity has been stripped away - now top decks all feature <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace, the Mind Sculptor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jace, the Mind Sculptor\">Jace, the Mind Sculptor</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day of Judgment\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Day of Judgment\">Day of Judgment</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth, Knight-Errant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Elspeth, Knight-Errant\">Elspeth, Knight-Errant</a>, etc...",

   "text_parsed": "<b>Aaron’s Random Card Comment of the Day #67, 3/28/10</b>\r<br />\r<br />Back in the day, subtypes weren’t always capitalized in rules text, which sometimes made said text difficult to decipher. “Guardians” is capitalized on the subtype line, but not in the rules text. One might guess its rules text referred to any creatures of the type “Guardian” and not just Ivory Guardians. If you look at the Alpha <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie Master\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Zombie Master\">Zombie Master</a>, you’ll see a similar lack of capitalization on “zombie” in the text box, and we all know that guy affects all Zombie creatures. But other cards in the <i>Legends </i>set muddy the waters a bit with inconsistent capitalization. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing Effigy\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Blazing Effigy\">Blazing Effigy</a> has “Effigy” capitalized, which might mean it isn’t referring to any creatures of the type Effigy (which it was) but rather other copies of itself. If you look at <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clergy of the Holy Nimbus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Clergy of the Holy Nimbus\">Clergy of the Holy Nimbus</a>, you’ll see the self-referential “Clergy” in its text box--its subtype was “Priest”--so shortening card names down to a single word was done a lot in that set. But then <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kobold Overlord\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Kobold Overlord\">Kobold Overlord</a> speaks of the subtype “Kobold,” which is capitalized… but then <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventurer's Guildhouse\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Adventurer's Guildhouse\">Adventurer's Guildhouse</a> doesn’t even capitalize “Legend,” the premier subtype of the set. There was no clear pattern regarding whether a word was a shorthand for a card name or a subtype.\r<br />\r<br />So what did Ivory Guardians do? A look at its mirror card, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beasts of Bogardan\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Beasts of Bogardan\">Beasts of Bogardan</a>, doesn’t help, as that card is pretty clear (at least I think so) in that it just affects itself, not other Beasts or creatures named “Beasts of Bogardan.”\r<br />\r<br />The answer becomes definitive in <i>Chronicles</i>, when much clearer templating tells us that Ivory Guardians affected all creatures with the subtype “Guardian,” which, at that time, was only Ivory Guardians themselves and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian Beast\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Guardian Beast\">Guardian Beast</a>. I’m not sure this was anything more than a guess at the original intended functionality, but the <i>Chronicles </i>printing did set the decision in stone, at least for a while.\r<br />\r<br />The Grand Creature Type Revision of 2007 eliminated the Guardian creature type, at which point Ivory Guardians became a Human Cleric--an error that was rectified a year later when they were changed to Giant Cleric. But without a narrow subtype, what were they supposed to do? Pump all Clerics? Hardly. No one would be able to infer that’s what the card did by reading any of the printed versions of it. So the Oracle team reverted them to a plausible interpretation of the <i>Legends </i>wording, a wording that they still have today: “Creatures named Ivory Guardians get +1/+1 as long as an opponent controls a nontoken red permanent.” Note the use of the term “nontoken” to match original functionality, which cared only that an opponent controlled a red card. That’s quite a roundabout trip for a bunch of Guardians.\r<br />\r<br />Fans of Ivory Guardians may have picked up on the homage we did to them in <i>Time Spiral</i>: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory Giant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ivory Giant\">Ivory Giant</a>. The link is more creative than it is mechanical.",

If you look at the Alpha [autocard]Zombie Master[/autocard], you’ll see a similar lack of capitalization on “zombie” in the text box, and we all know that guy affects all Zombie creatures. But other cards in the [i]Legends [/i]set muddy the waters a bit with inconsistent capitalization. [autocard]Blazing Effigy[/autocard] has “Effigy” capitalized, which might mean it isn’t referring to any creatures of the type Effigy (which it was) but rather other copies of itself. If you look at [autocard]Clergy of the Holy Nimbus[/autocard], you’ll see the self-referential “Clergy” in its text box--its subtype was “Priest”--so shortening card names down to a single word was done a lot in that set. But then [autocard]Kobold Overlord[/autocard] speaks of the subtype “Kobold,” which is capitalized… but then [autocard]Adventurer's Guildhouse[/autocard] doesn’t even capitalize “Legend,” the premier subtype of the set. There was no clear pattern regarding whether a word was a shorthand for a card name or a subtype.\r\n\r\nSo what did Ivory Guardians do? A look at its mirror card, [autocard]Beasts of Bogardan[/autocard], doesn’t help, as that card is pretty clear (at least I think so) in that it just affects itself, not other Beasts or creatures named “Beasts of Bogardan.”\r\n\r\nThe answer becomes definitive in [i]Chronicles[/i], when much clearer templating tells us that Ivory Guardians affected all creatures with the subtype “Guardian,” which, at that time, was only Ivory Guardians themselves and [autocard]Guardian Beast[/autocard]. I’m not sure this was anything more than a guess at the original intended functionality, but the [i]Chronicles [/i]printing did set the decision in stone, at least for a while.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Creature Type Revision of 2007 eliminated the Guardian creature type, at which point Ivory Guardians became a Human Cleric--an error that was rectified a year later when they were changed to Giant Cleric. But without a narrow subtype, what were they supposed to do? Pump all Clerics? Hardly. No one would be able to infer that’s what the card did by reading any of the printed versions of it. So the Oracle team reverted them to a plausible interpretation of the [i]Legends [/i]wording, a wording that they still have today: “Creatures named Ivory Guardians get +1/+1 as long as an opponent controls a nontoken red permanent.” Note the use of the term “nontoken” to match original functionality, which cared only that an opponent controlled a red card. That’s quite a roundabout trip for a bunch of Guardians.\r\n\r\nFans of Ivory Guardians may have picked up on the homage we did to them in [i]Time Spiral[/i]: [autocard]Ivory Giant[/autocard]. The link is more creative than it is mechanical.",

REALLY?!\n\nConsidering the Elder Dragons are single-handedly responsible for EDH, now known as Commander to players with creature type: human whippersnapper, I would say that one of the non-Bolas Elder Dragons REALLY should have been the highlight cards of the set with new art, with at least ONE friend from Legends set tagging along...alas, the most historical card we get is [autocard]Captain Sisay[/autocard].",

   "text_parsed": "<b>Aaron's Random Card Comment of the Day #5, 10/1/10</b>\r<br />Nostalgia is what makes this card at all palatable to me. I have countless <i>Chronicles </i>versions of this doof filling up some box in my garage, but the <i>Legends </i>version still has some mystique to it. Yes, I have cast this guy. No, he wasn’t impressive, even to my less-savvy 1995-era self.\r<br />\r<br />The way the <i>Legends </i>set introduced “gold” (multicolored) cards was interesting--they tied the weird mana costs to the brand-new creature type (that would later become a supertype) “Legend.” Each of those first gold cards had two significant drawbacks: they were harder to cast than normal cards, and there could only be one of each in play at a time… heck, for a long time there could only be one of each in your <i>deck </i>at a time! The modern designer/developer in me immediately wants to counteract those two drawbacks by making awesome cards, you know, like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran, the Siege Tower\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Doran, the Siege Tower\">Doran, the Siege Tower</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dralnu, Lich Lord\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dralnu, Lich Lord\">Dralnu, Lich Lord</a>. But the <i>Legends </i>folks didn’t do that. THEY MADE THEM ALL REALLY BAD. Well, almost all of them bad, but the point still stands. I mean, look at poor Kei here. His value versus <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samite Healer\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Samite Healer\">Samite Healer</a> is questionable--he costs twice as much in two colors and can’t prevent damage to players. He is flat-out shamed by <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum Custodian\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sanctum Custodian\">Sanctum Custodian</a>. A <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=G&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Green\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> legendary creature in modern <b>Magic </b>gets you something like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain Sisay\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Captain Sisay\">Captain Sisay</a>, a steady card-advantage machine. Kei is lame-sauce, representative of the whole inaugural cl&#224;ss of gold cards. Yet people loved--LOVED--them. They had uniqueness, they had flavor, they had awesome frames, awesome names, and some of them had gaudy powers, toughnesses, and abilities (not Kei). Packs of the <i>Legends </i>set flew off of shelves in hours.\r<br />\r<br />As far as the benefit of the rest of <b>Magic </b>is concerned, gold cards in <i>Legends</i> were executed perfectly. They got all the excitement a designer could hope out of a splashy new mechanic without using up any of the valuable design space. Truly amazing.\r<br />\r<br />Of course, what leaves me scratching my head is the question of just how intentional that perfect rollout was. Did the <i>Legends </i>teams know that they were slow-rolling all that multicolored cards were capable of, or were these their honest best attempts at splashy, powerful creatures? Maybe it’s a little bit of both, but I know the makers of <i>Ice Age</i>, <i>Mirage</i>, <i>Invasion</i>, <i>Ravnica</i>, and every other set that leverages multicolored cards thanks them, not just for inventing the mechanic, but for leaving it so much room to grow.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, back to Mr. Takahasi here. Even though his card text is forgettable, he played a notable role in some of Magic’s early novels, although you'd never know it from his lack of flavor text--odd for a legendary card from this set. You can read all about Kei on MTGSalvation’s storyline wiki (http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Kei_Takahashi). (Kei is apparently a “human/eumidian hybrid”, whatever that is.)",
   "text_posted": "[b]Aaron's Random Card Comment of the Day #5, 10/1/10[/b]\r\nNostalgia is what makes this card at all palatable to me. I have countless [i]Chronicles [/i]versions of this doof filling up some box in my garage, but the [i]Legends [/i]version still has some mystique to it. Yes, I have cast this guy. No, he wasn’t impressive, even to my less-savvy 1995-era self.\r\n\r\nThe way the [i]Legends [/i]set introduced “gold” (multicolored) cards was interesting--they tied the weird mana costs to the brand-new creature type (that would later become a supertype) “Legend.” Each of those first gold cards had two significant drawbacks: they were harder to cast than normal cards, and there could only be one of each in play at a time… heck, for a long time there could only be one of each in your [i]deck [/i]at a time! The modern designer/developer in me immediately wants to counteract those two drawbacks by making awesome cards, you know, like [autocard]Doran, the Siege Tower[/autocard] and [autocard]Dralnu, Lich Lord[/autocard]. But the [i]Legends [/i]folks didn’t do that. THEY MADE THEM ALL REALLY BAD. Well, almost all of them bad, but the point still stands. I mean, look at poor Kei here. His value versus [autocard]Samite Healer[/autocard] is questionable--he costs twice as much in two colors and can’t prevent damage to players. He is flat-out shamed by [autocard]Sanctum Custodian[/autocard]. A [2GW] legendary creature in modern [b]Magic [/b]gets you something like [autocard]Captain Sisay[/autocard], a steady card-advantage machine. Kei is lame-sauce, representative of the whole inaugural clàss of gold cards. Yet people loved--LOVED--them. They had uniqueness, they had flavor, they had awesome frames, awesome names, and some of them had gaudy powers, toughnesses, and abilities (not Kei). Packs of the [i]Legends [/i]set flew off of shelves in hours.\r\n\r\nAs far as the benefit of the rest of [b]Magic [/b]is concerned, gold cards in [i]Legends[/i] were executed perfectly. They got all the excitement a designer could hope out of a splashy new mechanic without using up any of the valuable design space. Truly amazing.\r\n\r\nOf course, what leaves me scratching my head is the question of just how intentional that perfect rollout was. Did the [i]Legends [/i]teams know that they were slow-rolling all that multicolored cards were capable of, or were these their honest best attempts at splashy, powerful creatures? Maybe it’s a little bit of both, but I know the makers of [i]Ice Age[/i], [i]Mirage[/i], [i]Invasion[/i], [i]Ravnica[/i], and every other set that leverages multicolored cards thanks them, not just for inventing the mechanic, but for leaving it so much room to grow.\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to Mr. Takahasi here.

The <b>Elder Dragon Legends</b> cannot boast as much among any of them! But, then, they have the truly good FLYING ability. Flying and TRAMPLE can each be considered worth a full {1} in, even many sets today, but particularly <i>Legends</i>. If you were to say that a card *has* to have 'either Flying/orTrample, or CMC = P', then you would consider less than 1/8-1/7 of the <i>Legends</i> Legends to be even playable, let alone good enough to build decks around. <br /><br />Palino: either Unlimited or 4th Edition was the Core Set. Players had at least <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly Bears\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Grizzly Bears\">Grizzly Bears</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra Angel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Serra Angel\">Serra Angel</a>s, Blue didn't want creatures, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord of the Pit\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lord of the Pit\">Lord of the Pit</a>, and ...alright, the Goblin deck really wasn't off the ground yet. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ali from Cairo\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ali from Cairo\">Ali from Cairo</a>? Was that their best? :( Still..there was enough to know that P/T should close to match CMC. Although T was probably valued exactly as much as P, unlike today.<br /><br />This card fails this test. He is in the Large group of <i>Legends</i> Legends whose Power or Toughness is exactly 1 less than their CMC. They essentially charged exactly {1} for being gold. But, not only does this card have a Borderline POWER NINE effect, it is a mana-ability moreover so you might consider it to be compensation. (I do not suggest applying this logic to the {U}/{B} legends that tap for {U} and {B}, but after all, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol Ring\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sol Ring\">Sol Ring</a> is better than Basic <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Island\">Island</a> and Basic <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Swamp\">Swamp</a>.) <br /><br />Therefore I suggest that between this card and vanilla Legend creatures like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit Ojanen\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jedit Ojanen\">Jedit Ojanen</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Svitri Scarzum\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Svitri Scarzum\">Svitri Scarzum</a>, you should pass dread judgment on LEGENDS the set with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=careful consideration\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"careful consideration\">careful consideration</a>: Is being Legedary, being Multicolored, having honestly epic names, flavor texts, and artwork, and being more noticeable in an entire format built for you, worth an actual full {1} mana to you? If so, then add roughly 1.35 stars to your Spike-based evaluations. If not, then you will be left with a scant handful of cards, with a few exceptions to your rule, totalling probably less than 15 out of 55 Legends being cards you'd willingly run. In particular you will have to be impressed by the abilities (on such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nebuchadnezzar\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Nebuchadnezzar\">Nebuchadnezzar</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol Bolas\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Nicol Bolas\">Nicol Bolas</a>) which disqualifies all of the Vanilla Legends I believe.<br /><br />Either 2/5 or 4/5. Need a copy and a group to playtest him. =P<br /><br />Unfortunately, I must also add that this one of the few cards in <i>Legends</i> where the P/T is close to desirable *and* the ability is desirable....but it's a TAP ability...which means...spending about a card to let you both attack/orblock and still get that mana, other wise he's a 5-cost mana rock that....I apologize: Dies to <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom Blade\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Doom Blade\">Doom Blade</a>. Dying to Doom Blade is not a good test for most Legends Legends, but most of the other ones really are trying to be fighters, and this one threatens to be a Mana Rock only. If he only had Vigilance! <br /><br />Frankly, my best Advice for any <i>Legends</i> EDH deck is: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma's Memorial\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Akroma's Memorial\">Akroma's Memorial</a> is more first-pickable than Sol Ring. I shit you not. :P It gives your Commander everything it's lacking and completely changes the conversation-- mostly, FlyingorTrample and Vigilance are the two best words on the artifact, because while the others make good creatures better, these can make 'bad' creatures suddenly good.",

In particular you will have to be impressed by the abilities (on such as [autocard]Nebuchadnezzar[/autocard] or [autocard]Nicol Bolas[/autocard]) which disqualifies all of the Vanilla Legends I believe.\n\nEither 2/5 or 4/5. Need a copy and a group to playtest him. =P\n\nUnfortunately, I must also add that this one of the few cards in [i]Legends[/i] where the P/T is close to desirable *and* the ability is desirable....but it's a TAP ability...which means...spending about a card to let you both attack/orblock and still get that mana, other wise he's a 5-cost mana rock that....I apologize: Dies to [autocard]Doom Blade[/autocard]. Dying to Doom Blade is not a good test for most Legends Legends, but most of the other ones really are trying to be fighters, and this one threatens to be a Mana Rock only. If he only had Vigilance! \n\nFrankly, my best Advice for any [i]Legends[/i] EDH deck is: [autocard]Akroma's Memorial[/autocard] is more first-pickable than Sol Ring. I shit you not. :P It gives your Commander everything it's lacking and completely changes the conversation-- mostly, FlyingorTrample and Vigilance are the two best words on the artifact, because while the others make good creatures better, these can make 'bad' creatures suddenly good.",
