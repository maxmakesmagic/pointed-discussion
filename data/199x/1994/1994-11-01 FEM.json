You tap for 1, then play high tide. Tap for 2, play two more. Now the third island produces more mana than the original 3 islands you had! I have a mill deck that goes off TURN 3 because of High Tide shenanigans. All it takes is a single untapper and a draw engine and you'll run into other untappers of various kinds.

Dark Ritual literally has no cards that cause infinite combos so easily and is nearly ALWAYS a card disadvantage. High Tides into a draw engine such as Brain Geyser can easily net 2+ cards (plus the others you had to use) resulting in card advantage, and that's without abusing it. WITH abusing it you fill up your hand, dump it, fill it, dump it, etc and you'll quickly get to your wincons as you do. Even better, once you do, you likely have yet even more untappers, protection, and the mana to cast those wincons right off. <br /><br />Further, enemies only have a slim opening to reliably counter the set of cards you'll play and if they screw it up you have the mana to counter their counter and go right back on doing what you were.

   "text_parsed": "Card of the Week #4 (1 day late)<br />Previous Card - Skyshroud Condor<br /><br />Oh yes. Homarid indeed. Oh how I love the random card button.<br /><br />So, what exactly can you do with a 2/2 for 3, that sucks 1/4 the time and is meh 1/2 the time and is decent 1/4 the time? You could suggest they make this card a 3/3 to be playable, OR you could play it anyway, because it is in fact a homarid.<br /><br />I'm going to go with the latter suggestion. So I'm going to play with Homarid. Yes that card from Fallen Empires. Yes that is in fact one of my favorite blocks. So what if it's bad. So flavorful! So much art! God I love that about fallen empires. I recently went out of my way to buy a play set of thallid from fallen empires, one of each art. They are that cool. I want to do that with Homarid, because this card is so cool. In case you are wondering, my favorite Thallid art is the Ron Spencer art and my favorite Homarid art is the Quinton Hoover art. <br /><br />Alas, I appear to have digressed for a few sentences, so back to playing a Homarid in a deck. And by that I mean an EDH deck. Where would you play Homarid in an EDH deck. You wouldn't look for the general whose strategy it would fit under, you would create an EDH deck just for Homarid, and just for the beautiful flavor in that beautiful four fold art package.<br /><br />So let's make a deck list for Homarid EDH, it will have to be mono blue and have to have all the Homarid and Tide counter cards. Lets start the list<br /><br />Homarid<br />Homarid Shaman<br />Homarid Spawning Bed<br />Homarid Warrior<br />Tidal Influence<br /><br />How beautifully short! But what does that say on Homarid Spawning Bed? Camarids? Lets get every other card that references those things to held add bulk and flavor.<br /><br />Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII<br /><br />Yep, thats it. Alright, so for this Homarid deck we have 6/100 cards. This is fun. No, lets find a general. A mono blue General. What are some good options, and why?<br /><br />Chisei, Heart of Oceans - Counter manipulation that compliments the Homarid ability and an Ocean flavor<br />Keiga - It is the &quot;tide&quot; star<br />Lorthos - The &quot;Tide&quot;maker<br /><br />It probably doesn't matter, but I'm going to roll with Chisei, because I like counter manipulation. So, we have 6 cards and a general and I'll leave 35 cards aside for land base. That makes 42/100 cards. <br /><br />So Homarids, they come from the ocean, they use lots of counters, tidal flavor, cyclical flavor. I can roll with this. Lets get some more tidal flavor.<br /><br />Dream Tide<br />High Tide<br />Inexorable Tide (Also provides cool counter manipulation)<br />Keiga, the Tide Star<br />Lorthos, the Tidemaker<br />Parallax Tide<br />Rushing Tide Zubera<br />Sliptide Serpent<br />Stormtide Leviathan<br />Tideforce Elemental<br />Tideshaper Mystic<br />Tidespout Tyrant<br />Tidewalker<br />Tidewater Minion<br />Tidal Bore<br />Tidal Courier<br />Tidal Flats<br />Tidal Kraken<br />Tidal Surge<br />Tidal Visionary<br />Tidal Warrior<br />Tidal Wave<br /><br />That makes for 65/100. Now we have three glaring needs. First off, there's quite a bit of krakens, leviathans, etc, so lets throw in a Quest for Ula's Temple, for giggles, which makes 66/100. Second, we need more counter bearing cards and counter messing cards. Third, this is ocean themed, we need more Island matters cards, like island walk and such.<br /><br />Lets start with a list of possible counter bearing cards<br /><br />Aquitect's Will<br />Chronozoa<br />Coral Reef<br />Floodchaser<br />Giant Oyster<br />Halimar Wavewatch<br />Iceberg<br />Illusionary Terrain<br />River Kelpie<br />Steady Progress<br /><br />All descent counter bearing/manipulating blue cards that fit into the Homarid theme and flavor. This will make 76/100. Now a list of more island matter cards.<br /><br />Benthic Behemoth<br />Deep-Sea Serpent<br />Dreamwinder<br />Fishliver Oil<br />Flooded Shoreline<br />Floodgate<br />Harbor Serpent<br />Island Fish Jasconius<br />Hammerhead Shark<br />Giant Shark<br />Devouring Deep<br />Dandan<br />Jokulmorder<br />Kukemssa Serpent<br />Leviathan<br />Lingering Mirage<br />Manta Ray<br />Marjhan<br />Piracy Charm<br />Sea Monster<br />Sea Serpent<br />Sea's Claim<br />Seasinger<br />Segovian Leviathan<br />Serpent of the Endless Sea<br />Slipstream Eel<br />Slipstream Serpent<br />Spreading Seas<br />Thing from the Deep<br />Vodalian Serpent<br /><br />That Brings our count up to 105/100, which means we'll need to cut five cards. Lets cut the fish, as they don't complement Quest for Ula's Temple. Say goodbye to<br /><br />Island Fish Jasconius<br />Hammerhead Shark<br />Giant Shark<br />Devouring Deep<br />Dandan<br /><br />Alright That brings our count down to 100/100 cards. Now lets find a mana base. I want at least 20 Islands. Actually I'd make them Snow-Covered Islands just to confuse our opponent. So what lands should be run besides basics? Let's take a look.<br /><br />Coral Atoll<br />Halimar Depths<br />Reliquary Tower<br />Sand Silos<br />Saprazzan Skerry<br />Svyelunite Temple<br /><br />And the Rest are Snow-Covered Islands. <br /><br />Now you can always tweak to your liking. More counters, less Leviathans. More Proliferate when it comes out. find some good artifacts to throw in. Whatever you want. But if you really want to run Homarid EDH what you really have to do is have a really cool play group and convince them to let you run Homarid (this card) as your general. If you can do it, I say you run Homarid EDH, and be hailed in all places.",
