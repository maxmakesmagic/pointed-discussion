It's a blue 1/1 for U and no drawback, which I usually take as meaning \"worth at least a 2.5\" and it has an actual possible advantage that costs you no extra mana. It's not good enough of an advantage to earn it a 3, but it's definitely a 2.5 level \"i could maybe play this\" card.",

That being said, giving this creature flying as a 1/1 for 1 would make it too powerful to the standards of creature balance that existed at that time.

If this were printed today, due to the increase in average power rating of creatures, they probably would have given this 1 mana 1/1 flying with it's ability, but back in The Dark Days (had to had the pun) of Magic creatures, they decided to not give it flying.",
