Mono artifacts tapped when used (check Alpha <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana Vault\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mana Vault\">Mana Vault</a>), poly artifacts didn't tap when used (check Alpha <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul Net\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Soul Net\">Soul Net</a>) and continous artifacts just lied there and affected the game (check Alpha <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter Orb\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Winter Orb\">Winter Orb</a>). Now the rule was that you couldn't use tapped poly artifact and tapped continous artifact didn't work (of course you couldn't use tapped mono artifact either because tapping was cost to its use, but more on that later).<br /><br />Now WoTC removed the definitions mono-, poly- and continous artifacts by strapping the nefangled tap symbol (no, not the existing: check Revised <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana Vault\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mana Vault\">Mana Vault</a>) to mono artifacts in Revised edition and changed the artifact rule to say: non-creature artifacts don't work while tapped. Now the <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana Vault\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mana Vault\">Mana Vault</a>, said the nitpickers, won't ping the controller and they cannot untap it, because it doesn't work when tapped. This of course was ridiculous bull, but the WoTC rules commitee took it into their heart, pondered a while and made the ruling. Instead of returning back to the working mono-, poly- and continous artifacts separation they decided that tapped artifacts work and errated some continous artifacts not to work while tapped (check <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling Mine\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Howling Mine\">Howling Mine</a>). <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter orb\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Winter orb\">Winter orb</a> didn't get that errata and so that strategy is then gone.<br /><br />Artifact creatures has always worked just like any other creature.",

Poly and Continous artifacts working while tapped(1). They errated few but not all and ruined many decks.\n\n2. [autocard]Power Surge[/autocard] made obsolete by eliminating manaburn.\n\n(1) For those who don't know what this was about I repeat it here:\n\nIn the begining there were mono-, poly- and continous artifacts. Mono artifacts tapped when used (check Alpha [autocard]Mana Vault[/autocard]), poly artifacts didn't tap when used (check Alpha [autocard]Soul Net[/autocard]) and continous artifacts just lied there and affected the game (check Alpha [autocard]Winter Orb[/autocard]). Now the rule was that you couldn't use tapped poly artifact and tapped continous artifact didn't work (of course you couldn't use tapped mono artifact either because tapping was cost to its use, but more on that later).\n\nNow WoTC removed the definitions mono-, poly- and continous artifacts by strapping the nefangled tap symbol (no, not the existing: check Revised [autocard]Mana Vault[/autocard]) to mono artifacts in Revised edition and changed the artifact rule to say: non-creature artifacts don't work while tapped. Now the [autocard]Mana Vault[/autocard], said the nitpickers, won't ping the controller and they cannot untap it, because it doesn't work when tapped. This of course was ridiculous bull, but the WoTC rules commitee took it into their heart, pondered a while and made the ruling. Instead of returning back to the working mono-, poly- and continous artifacts separation they decided that tapped artifacts work and errated some continous artifacts not to work while tapped (check [autocard]Howling Mine[/autocard]). [autocard]Winter orb[/autocard] didn't get that errata and so that strategy is then gone.\n\nArtifact creatures has always worked just like any other creature.",

   "text_posted": "This card is great.  Because it is an instant, you can use it on your opponent's turn, thus getting cards immediately for 0 mana (due to the cantrip delay).  Did I mention that this also rocks when playing [autocard]Magus of the Future[/autocard] and other things that let you see the top card of your library?  You can get rid of those bad draws when you do not need a land, or the next card, because this makes you shuffle.  All in all, a great utility card, and a cheap draw spell for the patient.",

It's fine having a hypothetical general, but in the majority of my real EDH games (which are multiplayer) he did nothing. 1v1, I feel he may very well have an edge, but in most EDH games, LoT is not going to be useful. And I say EDH games, because in most 60 card decks, I am fairly certain he won't be considered.<br /><br />Firstly, he dictates your deck thoroughly. Sure you can slap <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topor Orb\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Topor Orb\">Topor Orb</a> in (which is in fairly boring), but that's one card in 100. You have to find it. Then he doesn't have trample of evasion, so add in cards for that. You're effectively running a Voltron deck, and it leaves little room to do any other crazy stuff with what is an awesome tribal: zombies. So why not just run another Voltron deck? And if so, there are plenty of other generals out there who suit this style of play much better. LoT sits in the uneasy realm of not really a standard Voltron general, and not really an awesome zombie-tribal general.<br /><br />Secondly, I can certainly deal with life loss, and perhaps even want my opponents to draw cards in a group-hug kind of way. But the MUST sacrifice 2 creatures is what puts this card waay out of reasonable playability for me. EDH is a slow format. I know hardly anyone that has more than a couple of one-drops in their deck. Don't let that 4 mana casting cost fool you - you'll not be seeing Mr Tresserhorn for a while. Until you've set up a token system, or put out a few expendable creatures. Even then, with the number of instant-speed removals in EDH, you'll need to make sure you have at least 3 creatures out, just in case. And even then, bounce mechanics are prevalent in EDH. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying maze\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mystifying maze\">Mystifying maze</a>, bouncy angels, blue cards, etc etc… LoT gets bounced far too often and will either have to sac himself, or sac nearly your entire board. And if your Topor orb is still out when he gets bounced, your opponents aren't playing right.<br /><br />I'm sure if you're lucky, or determined, you'll get him to work most of the time, but for tribal or voltron, there are simply better options. For me, he's going in my collection and taking pride of place there. There's no denying he's a cool card. Just not one I'd use as my general.",

This allowed you to get a creature to attack and defend with, one that could attack immediately if you used this ability on their turn.  As a land, this is uncounterable, and as a player of counterspells, you could thwart their attempts on killing your Outpost.  A lot of these decks also played [autocard]Wrath of God[/autocard] for when things got out of hand, but you would be able to pump out a soldier on an empty board, provided you had the mana for it.\n\nIn modern times, land destruction is not as prevalent as it once was, and the Soldier tribe has tons of support, making this card once again quite powerful.",
