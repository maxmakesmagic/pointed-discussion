Remember to carefully read the cards before commenting on them.\n\nAs for Turn 2 Marit Lage, it's fairly easy:\nTurn 1: Play Dark Depths\nTurn 2: Play Swamp, cast Dark Ritual, Play Vampire Hexmage with 2 floating (no mana burn; let the third fizzle), sac Hexmage to target Dark Depths, and presto! Turn 2 Marit Lage. No haste, mind you...but that's a turn three swinger for 20 flying. Not bad.\n\nBut yeah...back to the card this thread's on:\n\nTurn 1: land of some mana-producing type. Play Sol Ring, Play 2 Dreadnoughts, sac one to the other. Since they read \"enters the battlefield\" and then the ability triggering, it strikes me that you can sac on to the other, in order to keep on out. Not entirely certain if this works...but the logic seems to be there. Corrections/Comments?\n",

Yes, if this card were blue, it would be terrible. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove Soul\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Remove Soul\">Remove Soul</a>/<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence Scatter\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Essence Scatter\">Essence Scatter</a> are already subpar compared to the best blue countermagic, so a version that also costs 3 life would be utterly unplayable.<br /><br />HOWEVER, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withering Boon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Withering Boon\">Withering Boon</a> is black. This exempts it from comparison to other traditional counterspells. We have to examine it on its own terms. On BLACK's terms.<br /><br />Firstly, for an off-color effect, it is appropriately priced at <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /> and 3 life. Black spells typically demand a little extra...incentive...to have added functionality, and that's exactly what we see here. The question is whether that &quot;added functionality&quot; is something anybody wants. In other words, does a black mage ever care about countering a creature spell?<br /><br />The answer is yes. Black kill spells, while ubiquitous, tend to have some targeting restrictions, such as nonblack or nonartifact. Furthermore, mono-black doesn't have an effective response to powerful comes-into-play effects, such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval Titan\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Primeval Titan\">Primeval Titan</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolation Giant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Desolation Giant\">Desolation Giant</a>. It's even worse when a copy of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iona, Shield of Emeria\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Iona, Shield of Emeria\">Iona, Shield of Emeria</a> hits the stack, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkwell Leviathan\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Inkwell Leviathan\">Inkwell Leviathan</a> is comparably bad.<br /><br />At that point, the mono-black mage has very few options. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dash Hopes\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dash Hopes\">Dash Hopes</a> isn't likely to work at crucial moments, and there's hardly any guarantee that he has a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromgald Cabal\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Stromgald Cabal\">Stromgald Cabal</a> at the ready. Same with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgrip\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Deathgrip\">Deathgrip</a>, and even if he <i>does</i> have one, the other, or both, those two can't handle everything. The black mage can turn to something like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brittle Effigy\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Brittle Effigy\">Brittle Effigy</a>, but why would he prepare such a spell, considering all the more efficient creature-kill spells available to him? Furthermore, it won't stop CIP abilities and shrouded creatures. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor Orb\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Torpor Orb\">Torpor Orb</a> can deal with the former, but he would have to be expecting to have to stifle some triggers. It's a long shot unless he knows exactly whom he's fighting.<br /><br /><a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withering Boon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Withering Boon\">Withering Boon</a> may be the mono-black mage's only viable, low-cost option to stop a game-ending shrouded or indestructible creature from hitting the board. Furthermore, it shouldn't be too difficult to leave the mana open; if his opponent doesn't cast a threat large enough to merit the counterspell, then the black mage can simply wait and cast a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Terror\">Terror</a> during his opponent's end step. It's a typical control tactic, and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withering Boon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Withering Boon\">Withering Boon</a> is a control spell in a control color. It does its job, and it does it for a reasonable price. Not only that, but it is effective against almost any creature spell, so its usefulness is only bounded by the black mage's paranoia that a more unkillable threat may lie in wait should he waste his rare countermagic.<br /><br />So, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withering Boon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Withering Boon\">Withering Boon</a> effectively fills a empty role in black magic. But that isn't to say it is the best way of doing so; after all, blue and black are allies, and blue can counterspell like no other. So, why not just splash blue?<br /><br />There are many reasons to run mono-black: <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian Obliterator\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Phyrexian Obliterator\">Phyrexian Obliterator</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lashwrithe\">Lashwrithe</a>, to name a few recent examples. Splashing blue can mess with the tempo of the deck. There are several lands that might help, but these are fairly expensive, and there's no guarantee they'll come up in a game. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth\">Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth</a> has already been mentioned by others, but it's worth repeating here.<br /><br />Furthermore, the black mage may already be multiclassing in other colors than blue, making mana-balancing a serious issue. Other colors hardly have any better countermagic, but it might be too difficult to splash another color to gain access to such spells. In those cases, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withering Boon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Withering Boon\">Withering Boon</a> may be the best solution for certain problem-creatures.<br /><br /><br />So, yeah, I think <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withering Boon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Withering Boon\">Withering Boon</a> is a good card. It might not be the best card for its effect, but it gives black access to solid countermagic, if in a sometimes redundant area. Options are always good.",

Same with [autocard]Deathgrip[/autocard], and even if he [i]does[/i] have one, the other, or both, those two can't handle everything. The black mage can turn to something like [autocard]Brittle Effigy[/autocard], but why would he prepare such a spell, considering all the more efficient creature-kill spells available to him? Furthermore, it won't stop CIP abilities and shrouded creatures. [autocard]Torpor Orb[/autocard] can deal with the former, but he would have to be expecting to have to stifle some triggers. It's a long shot unless he knows exactly whom he's fighting.\n\n[autocard]Withering Boon[/autocard] may be the mono-black mage's only viable, low-cost option to stop a game-ending shrouded or indestructible creature from hitting the board. Furthermore, it shouldn't be too difficult to leave the mana open; if his opponent doesn't cast a threat large enough to merit the counterspell, then the black mage can simply wait and cast a [autocard]Terror[/autocard] during his opponent's end step. It's a typical control tactic, and [autocard]Withering Boon[/autocard] is a control spell in a control color. It does its job, and it does it for a reasonable price. Not only that, but it is effective against almost any creature spell, so its usefulness is only bounded by the black mage's paranoia that a more unkillable threat may lie in wait should he waste his rare countermagic.\n\nSo, [autocard]Withering Boon[/autocard] effectively fills a empty role in black magic. But that isn't to say it is the best way of doing so; after all, blue and black are allies, and blue can counterspell like no other. So, why not just splash blue?\n\nThere are many reasons to run mono-black: [autocard]Phyrexian Obliterator[/autocard] and [autocard]Lashwrithe[/autocard], to name a few recent examples. Splashing blue can mess with the tempo of the deck. There are several lands that might help, but these are fairly expensive, and there's no guarantee they'll come up in a game. [autocard]Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth[/autocard] has already been mentioned by others, but it's worth repeating here.\n\nFurthermore, the black mage may already be multiclassing in other colors than blue, making mana-balancing a serious issue. Other colors hardly have any better countermagic, but it might be too difficult to splash another color to gain access to such spells. In those cases, [autocard]Withering Boon[/autocard] may be the best solution for certain problem-creatures.\n\n\nSo, yeah, I think [autocard]Withering Boon[/autocard] is a good card. It might not be the best card for its effect, but it gives black access to solid countermagic, if in a sometimes redundant area. Options are always good.",

Luckily Bill Rose, the lead designer of <i>Mirage</i>, is my current boss.\r<br />\r<br />“I guarantee you this, it wasn’t in the set I handed off,” stated Bill after a long time staring at Favorable Destiny. Bill is a huge fan of simplicity, and this card clearly rubs him the wrong way, even a decade later. “We designed the set out of house (as contractors) and then the guys here all got to put their own cards in. Just tell everyone I’m sorry.”\r<br />\r<br />He tracked me down later in the day with further thoughts on what the card was trying to do. “Even then, we were trying to figure out how to make Auras good, but we just didn’t get it. That thing needed to be <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> for +1/+2 and your opponents can’t target enchanted creature, all the time. That would have been worth it.”\r<br />\r<br />I don’t think I’ve ever played this card, but I have played against it. When my college roommate Jake slapped it on his <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asmira, Holy Avenger\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Asmira, Holy Avenger\">Asmira, Holy Avenger</a> and beat the daylights out of me with it, I guess it didn’t matter how awkward the design was… it did it’s job. That’s the beauty of the game.",

[autocard]Holy Strength[/autocard] on a [autocard]Drudge Skeletons[/autocard] has a much different feel that Holy Strength on a [autocard]Crypt Rats[/autocard] or on a [autocard]Serra Angel[/autocard]; all that extra text does is pigeonhole and create extra variance beyond what Auras already do.\r\n\r\nSo what’s the story behind this card? Luckily Bill Rose, the lead designer of [i]Mirage[/i], is my current boss.\r\n\r\n“I guarantee you this, it wasn’t in the set I handed off,” stated Bill after a long time staring at Favorable Destiny. Bill is a huge fan of simplicity, and this card clearly rubs him the wrong way, even a decade later. “We designed the set out of house (as contractors) and then the guys here all got to put their own cards in. Just tell everyone I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\nHe tracked me down later in the day with further thoughts on what the card was trying to do. “Even then, we were trying to figure out how to make Auras good, but we just didn’t get it. That thing needed to be [W] for +1/+2 and your opponents can’t target enchanted creature, all the time. That would have been worth it.”\r\n\r\nI don’t think I’ve ever played this card, but I have played against it. When my college roommate Jake slapped it on his [autocard]Asmira, Holy Avenger[/autocard] and beat the daylights out of me with it, I guess it didn’t matter how awkward the design was… it did it’s job. That’s the beauty of the game.",

Another point is that you don't have to decide a turn before you actually need it, if you want a mountain or a swamp, which could be relevant.  With that said I really only see this as really useful in EDH or other Singleton formats.  Though as pointed out earlier, the card that is faster than this is [autocard]Bloodstained Mire[/autocard].",

   "text_parsed": "Coming into play tapped killed this land. Had it been able to provide mana on the turn it was played, it would have served as an interesting, but not world-shattering bit of quasi-mana-acceleration for blue.<br /><br />One copy would provide one more mana than an island on the turn it was played, and subsequent turns would alternate between having one additional mana, and one less mana than with only islands for mana production. Cumulatively, the total mana theoretically available would similarly alternate between being equal to running only islands, and being one greater than having run only islands.<br /><br />With two copies, the legendary rule could be circumvented via their phasing attribute. This could be used to gain a boost of one mana on the turn that the first was played, as compared to playing an island. The second could then be played on the following turn, canceling out the loss of the first copy. This effectively costs two land drops to ensure that you have two mana available on each turn from at least one copy of this card.

   "text_posted": "Coming into play tapped killed this land. Had it been able to provide mana on the turn it was played, it would have served as an interesting, but not world-shattering bit of quasi-mana-acceleration for blue.\n\nOne copy would provide one more mana than an island on the turn it was played, and subsequent turns would alternate between having one additional mana, and one less mana than with only islands for mana production. Cumulatively, the total mana theoretically available would similarly alternate between being equal to running only islands, and being one greater than having run only islands.\n\nWith two copies, the legendary rule could be circumvented via their phasing attribute. This could be used to gain a boost of one mana on the turn that the first was played, as compared to playing an island. The second could then be played on the following turn, canceling out the loss of the first copy. This effectively costs two land drops to ensure that you have two mana available on each turn from at least one copy of this card. Each subsequent turn would have no greater availability of mana as compared to having used islands. The cumulative total of mana that was available on each turn would only be one greater than having played with islands alone.\n\nThis would make Teferi's Isle marginally better than Island in the long term.
