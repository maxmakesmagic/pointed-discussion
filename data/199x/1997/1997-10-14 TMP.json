And if you REALLY wanna tick off your opponent. Throw a Porticullis in there for good measure.\nConsider also, if you turn your opponents Lands into creatures, or into artifacts they can be stolen in this manner and also put on Cold storage. \nThe only way your opponent can get his creatures back is to take control of Cold Storage himself, then sacrifice it. (Thus a Porticullis slows that process down greatly.)\n\nI have a denial deck built on this system and it's quite effective actually.\n\nIMO Cold Storage is very useful. I'd like to see it return in future expansions.",

   "text_parsed": "I seriously hope Wizards considers printing a modern variant of this card in some form.  It's an interesting mechanic, and it's SO close to carving a niche for itself in EDH.  The only thing that's holding it back is the additional tap in its activation cost.<br /><br />Don't see it?  Ok, lets consider this in a mono green deck list.  Green has always needed answers to flying creatures.  Without the tap cost this card would almost be on par with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=downdraft\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"downdraft\">downdraft</a> defensively.  In fact, for even numbers of attacking flying creatures the activation cost is effectively the same, except with this card you can pay the cost with colorless mana.  This is primarily due to the fact that for each flying creature you <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=downdraft\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"downdraft\">downdraft</a>, you can assign flying to a blocker.  For odd numbers of flying attackers it's nearly as good, requiring n+1 colorless mana for n attacking flyers.  That slight difference in cost is reasonable when you consider the additional utility this card provides, and the fact that you're playing mono green, and can probably afford it.  Ok, so <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=spidersilk armor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"spidersilk armor\">spidersilk armor</a> doesn't require continuous mana investment, but without the tap cost this card could offer so much more than bolstered defense against flying creatures.  On the attack it would allow you to grant your creatures flying while simultaneously <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=downdraft\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"downdraft\">downdrafting</a> your opponent's flying defenders.  This ability also lends itself to combos with flying hate you'll find elsewhere in green.  Ok, so flying is a big deal, but what about the other abilities this card applies to?<br /><br />I noticed in others' comments that trample was often overlooked when considering this card's potential.  It's true, green tends to have plenty of access to trample.  So why would it be relevant in a mono-green EDH deck?  The answer is simple.  It's relevant because you have access to trample.  Flying and trample are fairly common keywords, and as such interactions with either are going to be much more likely than with the other keywords involved.  Additionally green has a tendency to balance large beater cards or aggressive mechanics by excluding trample as an ability.  While you may be able to provide this keyword to those cards by other means, such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=rancor\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"rancor\">rancor</a>, this card would reduce the necessity to include such cards simply for that reason.  Green has plenty of trample cards that would be willing keyword donors.<br /><br />As for first strike and shadow they're just gravy.  There are some interesting mechanics that are possible with the shadow mechanic, but unless you're playing shadow yourself you're not likely to encounter cards with the ability.  First strike is more prominent than shadow, but still considerably less so than trample and flying.  It's a powerful ability to borrow, but in green hopefully your creatures will outsize that of your opponent.  It does however provide green with an answer to deathtouch.<br /><br />The other nice thing about this card is that it belongs to a family of cards that allow you to meddle with combat you're not involved in in multiplayer.  This can lead to some very interesting strategic play, and will occasionally promote temporary cooperation or alliances.  I personally love such mechanics as they provide varied play and increased interaction between decks.<br /><br />As far as future printing of this mechanic is concerned I'd love to see it left as an open ended activation cost, even if it's necessary to make it a green enchantment and lose the first strike and shadow abilities to do so.  The activation cost for the ability does need to maintain a CMC of two however so that it remains playable.  That being said that cost could be GG if necessary.  Splashability is nice, as the player could bring their own fliers into the mix, but it's not strictly necessary for the mechanic to shine.<br /><br />EDIT: Looking back I just noticed the one ruling this card has associated with it.  Removing the tap ability would allow a player to stack triggers in such a way that X creatures gain one of the abilities listed for 2X colorless mana, even if there is only one creature on the field with the ability.  This is an interesting wrinkle in the card's wording but it doesn't feel like a very green ability.  The mechanic might need to be reworked slightly to avoid this scenario for color and power level concerns.",

I think not.\n\nThe flavor text is quite amusing too.",

That means that the opponent can just play his creatures during his second main phase and they won't be hit by the Imp's ability. (They won't be one of \"those creatures\" that the ability chose.)

Capsize was a fundamental staple of blue control and is currently as staple of most D10/Type 4 piles/decks/cubes.  Recursive Bouncing from your hand is simply amazing.  Targetting any permanent makes it quite a nuissiance as it can even disrupt your mana flow.  Even without buyback 3 mana for a permanent bounce is a solid effect.  Late game this card can completely shut down decks that rely on single permanent bombs (like [autocard]Hellkite Overlord[/autocard]).",

If it has no delay counters on it the spell resolves.\"\r\n\r\nWhich means that it is always on the stack [b][u]all the time[/u][/b]. \r\nThat means: It can be targeted as a spell buy other spells.\r\n--[autocard]Time Stop[/autocard] does remove it too.\r\n--It can be countered at anytime by anyone, but cannot be delt damage before it resolves(if it is a creature).\r\n--It can be copied anynumber of times buy any number of sorces for X number of turns.\r\n--It never left to exile, it is still a morph creature and it will still morph as normal (if it gets\r\n [autocard]Desertion[/autocard] ed then the morph ability comes with you.)\r\n--any counters on the card are also remembered and any kicker or multi kicker costs are also remebered. \r\n--But you can't Suddenly change targets for a spell when it resolves either.\r\n\r\nLets say you cast [autocard]Swords to Plowshares[/autocard] and you cast [autocard]Ertia's Meddling[/autocard] for X=6. then you can use the abiltiy of [autocard]Izznet Guildmage[/autocard] for those six turns: during his turn, during your turn, durning any part of any turn. \r\n\r\nLets say your opponet casts [autocard]Disintregrate[/autocard] for X=12, and you cast [autocard]Ertia's Meddling[/autocard] for X=6. Now you have six turns to get a [autocard]Twin Cast[/autocard] and an [autocard]Izznet Guildmage[/autocard]. We won't discuss the amount of damage YOU are gonna do to the poor guy over the NEXT 6 TURNS. \r\nYou can use your own direct damage card like [autocard]Incinerate[/autocard].\r\n\r\nSorry Orical, but the text on the card WINS HANDS DOWN!!!",

You can do neat stuff with it and cards that give this creature protection from blue (a sort of blue [autocard]Eight-and-a-Half-Tails[/autocard].  But ultimately this guy is another look at how badly R&D was scared of anything resembling unblockable.  Of course, in this case you only need to usually spray one or two creatures since its rare to see multitudes of flying non-blue creatures.  Works well with [autocard]Curiosity[/autocard] in limited.",

This gives you the opportunity to cast it where the extra turn will not be so benefitial to your opponent. <br /><br />Control can abuse this card. If you leave mana open for a counterspell, an opponent may wanna refrain from casting a spell. You can cast meditate there, at end of turn. If they have no instants, then you draw 4 cards, and they go again. If used early on, the extra turn will not be so dangerous, and can be control via Daze, Foil, Misdirection, FoW, etc.<br /><br />Reset High tide on its own loves this card, as its skip next turn aspect becomes practically irrelevant.<br /><br />Meditate can definetely give up an upper hand in battle, but when incorrectly cast will probably cost you the game. A turn 3 counterspell bluffed meditate can be devastating to your opponent. ",

However, the true aspect of Meditate that makes it playable is its instant speed. This gives you the opportunity to cast it where the extra turn will not be so benefitial to your opponent. \n\nControl can abuse this card. If you leave mana open for a counterspell, an opponent may wanna refrain from casting a spell. You can cast meditate there, at end of turn. If they have no instants, then you draw 4 cards, and they go again. If used early on, the extra turn will not be so dangerous, and can be control via Daze, Foil, Misdirection, FoW, etc.\n\nReset High tide on its own loves this card, as its skip next turn aspect becomes practically irrelevant.\n\nMeditate can definetely give up an upper hand in battle, but when incorrectly cast will probably cost you the game. A turn 3 counterspell bluffed meditate can be devastating to your opponent. ",

Or ping the opponent if you really want. However, I personally don't think that that is a very exciting way to abuse Tibor and Lumia, because the red trigger is way more fun.

Yep, just get lots of swarming beating fliers, and beat. If you find that enjoyable, than go ahead.

There are some cool buff cards you can throw in this deck: Sword of Paruns to boost the offensive, or keep your guys alive, Sunken City, Grand Architect and Gauntlet of Power all boost your host of mono blue creatures, Sprite Noble and Gravitational shift, are both fine ways to boost fliers.  The rest of the deck is for lands and beating fliers.<br /><br />Kangee, I actually prefer, but I'm a large fan of tribal, especially Merfolk and Birds. Door of Destinies, Brass Herald, and Konda's Banner all make good tribal (and color) boosts, the white Glorious anthems are welcome, Gravitational shift fits as do lots of cheap white and blue birdies, especially Thrummingbird. How great is it to both hit an opponent with a bird and increase the power and toughness of all other birds at your command.

That's false. To activate the ability, you have to pay the costs associated with the ability. In this case, you have to {T} him, along with two other creatures you control. Even if he just had to {T} to use it, using the first ability on Freed from the Real wouldn't help him out since if he's tapped you can't pay the {T} cost to activate the ability. The first ability of Freed from the Real helps him out if you have 4 other creatures on the field, because then you can use the ability twice, but oftentimes you simply won't have the creatures to make that work.<br /><br />The reason this card is insane is because it bounces permanents. Most bounce spells today say 'nonland permanent' or 'creature' These are limited types because you can't hit lands. It's brutal to bounce your opponent's shocklands and have him think about whether or not it's worth it to take 2 repeatedly. Basically, once this hits the field, assuming you have the other creatures to help him out, your opponent can't play lands, and if he lands an actual threat, you can just bounce it. 4 toughness dodges bolt too :D<br /><br />The only real problem is that sometimes he'll just be a 1/4 for {3}{U}.

[autocard]Draco[/autocard] recieves beneifts from Prismatic Omen, Skyshroud does not give benefit.\r\n\r\nAlso, this card is, in my opinion, far better than the other two elves. Why? Because it functions both as a mana producer, and as a mana filter. For another example of a mana filter, look at [autocard]Cascade Bluffs[/autocard]. It's a land that can turn a regular land into an advanced land. That + island = 2 red mana. Similiarly, with Skyshroud elves, you can base a GWR as mostly G, and even get a [autocard]Primalcrux[/autocard], and still be able to cast your R and W spells.",

Yeah.\n\nAnother interesting facet of Tempest block was the flavor text 'telling a story'. The pitfall of that is that we really don't get 'a story' about the drake from its flavor text . . . just about Ertai and that apparently he was doing something with runes in a canyon.",

This however works more like [autocard]Duress[/autocard], in that you only get to kill the cards you see in their hand.\n\nMono-black in Scars of Mirrodin standard gets a similar toy called [autocard]Memoricide[/autocard]; at the convenience of only costing black, this new version of thought hemorrhage deals no damage to the player. The Worlds 2010 top 2 was a mirror match of blue black control and both players certainly ran Memoricides.",
