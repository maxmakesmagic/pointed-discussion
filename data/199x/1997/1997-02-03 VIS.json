Any idiot who plays this in their deck without thinking of combo should be shot. Obviously this is for combo! This isn't a bad card in itself, but if it's mana cost was 1B, people would be raging on how broken it would be.\n\nPeople talk about this card going with [autocard]Barren Glory[/autocard] without realizing that this card is on the same power level as Barren Glory. Both of these cards requires a lot of combo to pull off and they both win you the game when done correctly.\n\nAnyone ever think about floating mana for a [autocard]Second Sunrise[/autocard]? You could easily combo that with cards that trigger when they enter or leave the battlefield.",

Why not just give it flash?\n\nEDIT:\n@Leshrac_Nightstalker\nthe top portion of the card could simply read:\n\nFlash\nIf you cast Necromancy any time a sorcery couldn't have been cast, the controller of the permanent it becomes sacrifices it at the beginning of the next cleanup step.\n\nAll the cards in this cycle should, imho, be errata'd this way. They would still play the same but, yes, other cards that care about whether or not they have flash (which is extremely few) would interact differently with them... but so what? In fact, these cards (like mystical teachings, as you mentioned) [i]should[/i] interact with Necromancy because Necromancy actually DOES have flash when you think about it. Flash says: \"You may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.\" Can you cast Necromancy any time you could cast an instant? yes.\n\nEDIT: EDIT:\n@Leshrac_Nightstalker\nyea, i guess you're right about vedalken orrery and whatnot.",

Fly you lazy lobs, from STING! \n\nAlso, I believe there was a man from the Second Age known for killing lots of Trolls who was cited as writing a short verse he cried out every time he killed one.\n\nOh, Anduril Flame of the West? Yeah I would DEFINITELY sing that name in battle. :)\n\nThe trick is, don't just shout/sing the name of the sword- figure out a nice complete sentence for it ;)\n\n\nThe card itself is one I would STILL run today- remember folks: In a proper deck, you can win on the back of a 1/1 Goblin that enters the battlefield tapped.

I can only play one land a turn, but that's four green mana from one forest if that's possible.
