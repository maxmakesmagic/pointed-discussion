The ability will frequently either shut down the opponent's main phases, or prevent instants and flash spells from being cast. It will single-handedly shatter any deck that is based on counterspells.

I can guarantee that your opponent will not be happy. ",

And before someone tries to be funny, there were exceptions for artifacts having untap costs (Time Vault and Mana Vault for example) and specifically doing something if tapped (Mana Vault damage). Also, under those old rules, if you cast Animate Artifact to for example Howling Mine, then it would give extra draws even if tapped (as it would be an artifact creature).

This could be ghastly in conjunction with a [autocard]Swamp[/autocard] and pair of [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard]s in an opening hand, as there is very little that can stop a 5 powered black creature on the board that early.  His trample also means chump blocking is not a good option.  Should your opponent [autocard]Pacifism[/autocard] him, just let him die.  This card serves as a great example to illustrate why [autocard]Swords to Plowshares[/autocard] and [autocard]Path to Exile[/autocard] are so good - for a single [W] you can remove even aggressive early turn threats that other colors would have problems dealing with.\n\nAs for Gallowbraid itself, It's also effective design to demonstrate the risky nature of playing black.  Cumulative upkeep means that you first harm yourself, before you even have a chance at attacking, so it's possible that you take life loss and get nothing for it.  However, it comes with the price of risking removal and card disadvantage if it is thwarted somehow.",

Especialy counterproductive when its earlier in the game and you start burying lands. On the plus side though later in the game when you have tons of mana production this can actully help thin out lands.",
