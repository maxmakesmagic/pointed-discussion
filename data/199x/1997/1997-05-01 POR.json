At least I cannot see why wait until blockers have been declared or after damage assignments have been announced to play those.",
   "text_posted": "After attackers are declared there is a window where fast effects can be played. This can be played then.\n\n[autocard]Rain of Blades[/autocard] and [autocard]Sandstorm[/autocard] can also be played then, but they can be played after blockers have been declared and after damage assignments have been announced also and have effect. They can also be used on your own turn and outside an attack phase.\n\nAs there is almost no reason to play this on your own turn (eg. damage your own attackers) or outside attack phase, there is no lost functionality over Rain of Blades or Sandstorm. At least I cannot see why wait until blockers have been declared or after damage assignments have been announced to play those.",
