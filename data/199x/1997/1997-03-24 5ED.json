Attack with a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy Doll\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Stuffy Doll\">Stuffy Doll</a> and watch your opponent's head explode.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of this card is that it very specifically uses &quot;time counters&quot;, i.e. the same counters used for suspended cards.  This provides some very fun interactions with cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira's Timebug\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jhoira's Timebug\">Jhoira's Timebug</a> or (even better) <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timecrafting\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Timecrafting\">Timecrafting</a>. With an Infinite Hourglass out, Timecrafting basically reads &quot;all creatures get +X/+0&quot;.<br /><br />Finally, it's a great &quot;political&quot; card in multiplayer games.  People may help keep you alive just because their <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ornithopter\">Ornithopter</a> comes out as a 7/2 for Zero mana.<br /><br />EDIT: Fun question: what happens if you use <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira of the Ghitu\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Jhoira of the Ghitu\">Jhoira of the Ghitu</a> to suspend the card?  Does it affect creatures while suspended?  I wouldn't think so, and yet cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic Dragon\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Pardic Dragon\">Pardic Dragon</a> have text which works while suspended.",

Her original text: \"Tap to make another creature 0/2 until end of turn. Treat this exactly as if the numbers in the lower right of the target card were 0/2. All special characteristics and enchantments on the creature are unaffected.\" Turns out to be pretty simple, huh?",

If you respond to the comes-into-play ability by returning Dance of Many to your hand, the leaves-play-ability will trigger, go on the top of the stack, and resolve first. When it does, it tries to remove the copy token from the game, but since that token hasn't been created yet, it doesn't do anything. Then the comes-into-play ability resolves and creates a token that is completely independant of Dance of Many. If you replay Dance of Many, it's a whole new enchantment that doesn't remember its affiliation with that token, and that won't force you to sacrifice it if it leaves play again (and vice-versa). There you go, one unbound clone per turn !",

When it comes to <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol Bolas\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Nicol Bolas\">Nicol Bolas</a>, prepare for plotlines and stories to be very long and confusing. :) Two of the legends from <i>Legends</i>, are <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol'Kanar the Swamp King\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sol'Kanar the Swamp King\">Sol'Kanar the Swamp King</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dakkon Blackblade\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dakkon Blackblade\">Dakkon Blackblade</a>. Dakkon didn't participate in the Madaran conflicts, (to my knowledge). Where did his Blackblade come from? <br /><br />From Geyadrone Dihada.

Why, she gave it to him. She also gave him apparently-planeswalker like Powers. <br /><br />Now you might be thinking HOLD THE PHONE. Isn't Bolas a Planeswalker? and if Dakkon is a Planeswalker, why does he get a card? Well, Dakkon Blackblade and Nicol Bolas at the time of these TERRIBLY Ancient events, they had the *ability to planeswalk* as much as the <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyship Weatherlight\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Skyship Weatherlight\">Skyship Weatherlight</a> did, but its unclear whether Dakkon even ever had a Spark, and its Very clear that Bolas' Spark hadn't exactly ignited until the end of the Elder Dragon War.

The <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy Citadel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Unholy Citadel\">Unholy Citadel</a> was Geyadrone Dihada’s huge, mobile fortress, a collection of bones and rubble on spidery legs built by <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol'Kanar the Swamp King\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Sol'Kanar the Swamp King\">Sol'Kanar the Swamp King</a> (taken straight from Wikipedia) But Dakkon does indeed get his Blackblade back. Except because Dihada is one of those Evil-Witch types, she does lots of trickery, manipulation, and meanness, and manages to set it up that Dakkon has lost his ability to Planeswalk AND he's got to serve her. And there are other characters involved that are related to other important characters who are by now long-dead. <br /><br />Now here's some more fun History-- during a period of time that my Wikipedia Searching can't pinpoint EXACTLY, but is &quot;Ancient Dominarian&quot;, either actually at the END of the Dragon War, or between the Dragon War and the Planeswalker War, Dihada actually killed <br /><br />One-Third of all the Elder Dragons in the Existence of the Multiverse, including the 6th one that doesn't get a Legends card because MTG is base-5, not base-6, and maybe because by the time Legends happens she's already been killed.

Because Blue needs an Elder Dragon.<br /><br />And, in fact, it's BECAUSE her hand in the deaths of so many of Nicol Bolas' blood relatives kind of gets unavoidably brought up, that the Planeswalker War ignites on the Null Moon, which is kind of like a cross between an Entmoot and 20th century Europe, because Planeswalkers don't like each other as much as Ents do, and the Elder Dragon Piru is basically Archduke Ferdinand. <br /><br />You can waste probably a straight week looking up all the stories of Legends. =D I never even got to explaining what's so important about Ulgrotha!

It it was a Planar Chaos instant that said \"{R}- Target creature gets -0/-1 and can't block this turn\" it wouldn't be so bad, would it?\n\nSo crappy, but not horrible. ",

Here’s why:<br />The maximum benefit of this card comes from gameplays that count on some land being available for counter styles or specific moments to strike, so rather than keeping some land available only for nothing to happen, you throw in this land which builds up counters and allows you a decent transition from defence or build-up rounds to an offensive go in for the kill rounds.

Seriously, zero cmc and it can tap to add {U}. Not to mention that it triggers landfall. And seriously, why in the world did wizards decide that this card shouldn't be affected by the four-card rule? Plus, this combos with so many other cards. For example, with this card and a black lotus on turn one, you can add 4 mana, the equivalent of 4 moxen. On average, that means that this card is as good as two mox sapphires, even better than I said before. With four of these, you can play Jace, the Mind Sculptor for free. If that's not good, then what is? Also, lets say you have one of these, a Kiki-Jiki, and a sky hussar. BAM, that's 1,000,000 damage, right then and there. 5/5",
