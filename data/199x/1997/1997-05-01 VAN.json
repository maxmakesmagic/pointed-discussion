   "text_posted": "@Squiz: Vanguard started back in the Weatherlight saga where they printed oversized cards (like Archenemy/Planechase/Commander Precon General size) for storyline characters such as [autocard]Urza[/autocard] and [autocard]Karn[/autocard] that have enchantment-like effects for you and/or your creatures and modify your starting and maximum hand size and your starting life total. Like Planar cards and Archenemy schemes, they can't be targeted or removed from the game. Although they stopped printing paper ones :( they continue to have them for MtG Online, and at some point started doing ones based off of any creature, not just legendary ones.\n\n+1 to your hand to? Dang. I'd have expected +0 to hand and +5 to life or something.",
