As if white would have weaker destruction spells or the black reanimation spells were anything close to being overpowered.<br /><br />And by the way, not rebels have won the Pro-Tour, but <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax Wave\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Parallax Wave\">Parallax Wave</a>. With this card, you can remove 3 creatures an opponent controls for 3 turns... granting enough time to win with 3 <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steadfast Guard\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Steadfast Guard\">Steadfast Guard</a>s.<br /><br />Rebels have the big problem that although you can play a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramosian Sergeant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ramosian Sergeant\">Ramosian Sergeant</a>, he is a mere 1/1 until you have 3 mana available. It's getting even worse with the <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramosian Lieutenant\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ramosian Lieutenant\">Ramosian Lieutenant</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramosian Captain\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Ramosian Captain\">Ramosian Captain</a>. By the 5th turn, you'll have one copy of each of them. Quite underwhelming.<br /><br />The Mercenaries look downwards, but also have low activation cost. Therefore the Cateran Persuader doesn't have to wait for the fourth land until he can use his ability. In the end, you can have more, but maybe weaker creatures. But weakness isn't such a problem, since you still draw cards and cast better cards normally.<br /><br />With the rebels on the other hand, you won't have mana for casting spells <b>AND</b> using the activated abilities. So this makes you hope for land cards or similar effects (<a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea's Cradle\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Gaea's Cradle\">Gaea's Cradle</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind over Matter\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mind over Matter\">Mind over Matter</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Awakening\">Awakening</a>).<br /><br />But all this balance was ruined with the print of <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero\">Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero</a>. Since she only needs 2 mana to look for an <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steadfast Guard\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Steadfast Guard\">Steadfast Guard</a>, she is REALLY powerful. <br /><br />If I would have been a designer during Masques block, I would have swapped the rebel and mercenary abilities.<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Marshalling the Troops = search your library for a rebel card.<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Ramosian Foot Soldier = 1/1 First Strike<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Defiant Falcon = 1/2 flying, vigilance<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Ramosian Crossbowman= 1/1 <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=tap&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Tap\" align=\"absbottom\" />: deal 1 damage to attacking/blocking creature<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Ramosian Seargeant = 2/1 First Strike, search for rebels<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Ramosian Skydiver = 2/1 Flying, protection red/black<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=1&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"1\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Ramosian Lieutemant = 2/2, search for rebels, other rebels get +1/+1 u.e.o.t.<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Ramosian Captain = 2/3 search for rebels, <img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=2&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"2\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" />: target creature gains protection<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=3&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"3\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Ramosian Commander = 2/4, search for rebels, reshuffle rebels from graveyard into lib.<br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=4&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"4\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=W&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"White\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Ramosian Sky Marshal = 3/3 flying, search for rebels, when attacked, untap all creatures y.c.<br /><br />For the mercenaries, it fits better that they are hidden and underwhelming. More powerful creatures are paid (in form of mana). They are Sleeper Agents, Assassins or Devoted Minions in search for their evil master. They are the footman who try to open a portal, so that the hordes of horror can enter this realm. Therefore a black merc should be like the current rebel:<br /><br /><img src=\"/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;name=B&amp;type=symbol\" alt=\"Black\" align=\"absbottom\" /> - Phyrexian Sleeper Agent = 1/1 search for mercs<br /><br />This is underwelming until you have 3 mana. Only then, he can bribe a brute or &quot;call your master&quot;. In this theme, it fits quite well to add cards like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark Ritual\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dark Ritual\">Dark Ritual</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood Vassal\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Blood Vassal\">Blood Vassal</a>, since they allow you to activate the ability much earlier. Abilities that have &quot;discard a card&quot; in their activation or upkeep cost also fit, since you'll draw cards and don't have te mana to activate the ability AND casting the new spell. (see <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mercenary Knight\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Mercenary Knight\">Mercenary Knight</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire Hounds\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Vampire Hounds\">Vampire Hounds</a> or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie Infestation\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Zombie Infestation\">Zombie Infestation</a>).

As if white would have weaker destruction spells or the black reanimation spells were anything close to being overpowered.\n\nAnd by the way, not rebels have won the Pro-Tour, but [autocard]Parallax Wave[/autocard]. With this card, you can remove 3 creatures an opponent controls for 3 turns... granting enough time to win with 3 [autocard]Steadfast Guard[/autocard]s.\n\nRebels have the big problem that although you can play a [autocard]Ramosian Sergeant[/autocard], he is a mere 1/1 until you have 3 mana available. It's getting even worse with the [autocard]Ramosian Lieutenant[/autocard] or [autocard]Ramosian Captain[/autocard]. By the 5th turn, you'll have one copy of each of them. Quite underwhelming.\n\nThe Mercenaries look downwards, but also have low activation cost. Therefore the Cateran Persuader doesn't have to wait for the fourth land until he can use his ability. In the end, you can have more, but maybe weaker creatures. But weakness isn't such a problem, since you still draw cards and cast better cards normally.\n\nWith the rebels on the other hand, you won't have mana for casting spells [b]AND[/b] using the activated abilities. So this makes you hope for land cards or similar effects ([autocard]Gaea's Cradle[/autocard], [autocard]Mind over Matter[/autocard] or [autocard]Awakening[/autocard]).\n\nBut all this balance was ruined with the print of [autocard]Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero[/autocard]. Since she only needs 2 mana to look for an [autocard]Steadfast Guard[/autocard], she is REALLY powerful. \n\nIf I would have been a designer during Masques block, I would have swapped the rebel and mercenary abilities.\n[W] - Marshalling the Troops = search your library for a rebel card.\n[W] - Ramosian Foot Soldier = 1/1 First Strike\n[1W] - Defiant Falcon = 1/2 flying, vigilance\n[1W] - Ramosian Crossbowman= 1/1 [T]: deal 1 damage to attacking/blocking creature\n[WW] - Ramosian Seargeant = 2/1 First Strike, search for rebels\n[2W] - Ramosian Skydiver = 2/1 Flying, protection red/black\n[1WW] - Ramosian Lieutemant = 2/2, search for rebels, other rebels get +1/+1 u.e.o.t.\n[2WW] - Ramosian Captain = 2/3 search for rebels, [2W]: target creature gains protection\n[3WW] - Ramosian Commander = 2/4, search for rebels, reshuffle rebels from graveyard into lib.\n[4WW] - Ramosian Sky Marshal = 3/3 flying, search for rebels, when attacked, untap all creatures y.c.\n\nFor the mercenaries, it fits better that they are hidden and underwhelming. More powerful creatures are paid (in form of mana). They are Sleeper Agents, Assassins or Devoted Minions in search for their evil master. They are the footman who try to open a portal, so that the hordes of horror can enter this realm. Therefore a black merc should be like the current rebel:\n\n[B] - Phyrexian Sleeper Agent = 1/1 search for mercs\n\nThis is underwelming until you have 3 mana. Only then, he can bribe a brute or \"call your master\". In this theme, it fits quite well to add cards like [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard] or [autocard]Blood Vassal[/autocard], since they allow you to activate the ability much earlier. Abilities that have \"discard a card\" in their activation or upkeep cost also fit, since you'll draw cards and don't have te mana to activate the ability AND casting the new spell. (see [autocard]Mercenary Knight[/autocard], [autocard]Vampire Hounds[/autocard] or [autocard]Zombie Infestation[/autocard]). And I would have loved to see an Mercenary version of [autocard]Soldevi Adnate[/autocard] or a black version of [autocard]Llanowar Elves[/autocard], just to be able to ramp up even faster.\n\nAll in all, I believe it would have been better for black to ramp up until they finally have the power to call the Archdemon to this world then for rebels to finally reach a [autocard]Jhovall Queen[/autocard] (by the time you have 7 mana).",

Once per turn to limit it to one token per turn (say, so you can't get a token, chump block, and get another). Why? So you can't follow-up Wrath with a chump in the same turn before turn 6? Because with both of those being CMC 4, ANY mana cost for the activation limits it to turn 5 or later (barring acceleration).\n\nI think the puzzle got a little too constrained.",

While the game does pick a winner based on what mode is being played, the title of &quot;winner&quot; can still be debated- somewhat (bear with me).

One tiny detail decided the game and you know what? In tournaments, most games are decided on the most small details. If you don't play in tournaments, then most games you see and experience are probably not close- at the point when the game is over, the winning player has 16 or more life with a full board of creatures and the losing player has only one creature.

I then play a dual land (which you tap with the Port probably) and then I play a Lotus Cobra, effectively ending your plan. Or, if I'm playing green, I ramp way too fast for Port to matter. If I'm playing red, I blow it up. Blue? I Stifle/Squelch/Twiddle it. Black? Can't really do anything about it, but if I'm running mono-black I probably don't care (unless I'm running Cabal Coffers). White? O-Ring. Sure, I waste a card, but your &quot;super-important land&quot; is gone.

You're tapping TWO mana to lock down ONE land. There are only a couple situations in which this would be good. First, if it's in set, because Masques was slow.

Mana Short taps all a player's lands. Mind Games taps a land. Mistbind Clique taps all lands and it's a creature. Mole Worms locks down a land. Opposition makes all your lands tap other lands. Reality Ripple phases out a land. Ring of Gix taps a land. Twiddle taps a land. Vedalken Certarch taps a land.<br /><br />Basically, in the games I play, I don't see how a land like this is &quot;so O.P.&quot; and is still $40.

Manalith, Signets, Sol Ring, Cameos, Diamonds (even though they're pretty bad), Moxes, Mana Myrs, Attendants, Ramos parts, Borderposts, Lotus parts (or Lotus itself), Mana/Milikin, Eggs, Obelisks, and Talismans are ALL commonly run in Extended/Vintage, so Rishadan port is pretty useless in my opinion.

   "text_parsed": "jimbob123432-- here's the first and most important part of the argument: It's a LAND, not a spell. All the cards you named that are 'better' than this card are spells. This costs no mana whatsoever to put down, and you can choose whether or not to activate it. For some &quot;Utility Lands&quot;, as they're called, like Maze of Ith, you never even have to activate them, you just have the threat of them and they're used as deterrence. That type of move is much more common in multi-player, but some cards (again, Maze of Ith) are so good that you can effectively use deterrence in a 2-player game.<br /><br />The second most important part of this card is super closely related to the first- it hits lands. It IS a land. It is its own best counter. It costs 0 resources to put down initially, and once you do, you are safe if your opponent has it. In some ways, this is a lot like the relationship Jace Beleren has to Jace, the Mind Sculptor, except that you want to play your Port first before the other guy, and you want to be the second guy to play a Jace so you can destroy their Big Jace with your Little Jace. On top of that, Rishadan Port doesn't just say 'tap target Rishadan Port'- it hits ANY. LAND. Any Land. For example those Maze of Iths I keep banging about. Or maybe it's an Urzatron piece. Or maybe Tolarian Academy. Or maybe who knows what. Rishadan Port is second only to Strip Mine in land disruption. <br /><br />The fact that all lands are 0-drops is something which can't be understated enough, and it's part of why I think every 0-drop artifact ever, even the outdated 'bad' ones are completely viable in Kitchen Table decks against more 'serious' cards. It's also why some of the most incredible cards IN THE GAME are lands. Utility Lands like Maze of Ith, Manaproducers like Tolarian Academy, even Damage Sources on Lands are not to be overlooked. Shivan Gorge is no Grim Lavamancer sure, but it's legitimately good enough for multiplayer to make the cut. A spell that costs 2R that hits each player for 1, even at Instant Speed and uncounterable, would NOT be good enough.<br /><br />Lands are not only 0-drops, they are REUSEABLE (most of the time). Let me think of the most powerful spells I can think of....Ancestral Recall and Time Walk. Devastating effects, insanely undercosted. You really want to counter these spells if you can. If you don't, your opponent gets something absolutely nuts...once. Then the cards go to the graveyard. Sure, they might have recursion in their deck, but the cards don't actually have flashback or buyback printed on them. Lands are spells that have buyback/flashback forever, at no further cost other than untapping, and they continue to do what you what them to do until they're destroyed. The activation cost on a land should be thought of as the buyback cost on a spell.<br /><br />Being a 0-drop is good, and every 0-drop non-land card in the Modern frame is just awesome. So there is never going to be a comparison between a spell and a land over a similar effect. Put it on a land and the card becomes much stronger. Now yes, you should never ever EVER base your deck on being 'all about one great card'- but that doesn't mean 'don't put a great card in your deck'. If a card is great, use it.<br /><br />Now evaluating the ability itself: well, everyone else does that all through the comments section here. I wanted to emphasize, for people that didn't think about it yet, how significant the difference is between lands and spells.  It all boils down to this: <br /><br />A) Lands are important<br />B) Utility Lands are GREAT<br />C) This is one of the best things to mess with both A and B, AND one of the best things to mess with ITSELF, which is a crucial point for metagaming.

The fact that the Time Spiral storage lands A) don't enter tapped B) produce two colors C) can tap for colorless is proof enough to my mind that the designers recognize these old storage lands were nearly useless.
