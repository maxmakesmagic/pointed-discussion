This card got me into magic.<br /><br />Of all the cards, of all the art work, this was the one that first got me to actually learn what Magic was. Look at the art. I mean look at it. For an 8 year old boy, seeing this card on a table and just looking at it. It was so cool. The only other card game I knew was Pokemon, but this looked like it came straight out of those Goosebumps books and that was just awesome. I knew I wanted to play this game, or at least get the cards because the art was so damn awesome.<br /><br />Now, unfortunately I didn't stick with it, but when I went to a new school a few years later, seeing the kids playing magic during indoor recess, I instantly remembered my old cards, and especially this guy. Well, I knew, if there was ever a chance, I wanted to play magic during indoor recess. I did, eventually. And even got to play some during outdoor recess. But then middle school came and I couldn't bother to be associated with anything seen as &quot;nerdy&quot; or &quot;geeky&quot; so I shunned magic. For 6 years, I didn't play magic.

And one of the few cards I had in my mind was this guy.<br /><br />Sure he isn't the best card ever, and sure his artwork doesn't compare to others, but this card got me into magic, and I will never forget it. In fact, I may get a copy, since I lost mine long ago, and I would proudly show it off on the first sheet of my collection for all people to see when they trade with me.",

This card got me into magic.\n\nOf all the cards, of all the art work, this was the one that first got me to actually learn what Magic was. Look at the art. I mean look at it. For an 8 year old boy, seeing this card on a table and just looking at it. It was so cool. The only other card game I knew was Pokemon, but this looked like it came straight out of those Goosebumps books and that was just awesome.
