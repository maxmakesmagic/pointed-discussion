Sure the guy ought to have stopped and wondered why his opponent was asking &quot;Are you sure&quot;, but he shouldn't be punished for a lapse in judgment, and Mike should be punished for engaging in a deliberate effort at deception, intentionally playing a card with outdated text in an attempt to trick an opponent into a mistake.  This doesn't prove Mike to be smarter than his opponent, it just proves him willing to be a jerk in order to claim a victory which is meaningless because he didn't learn anything from it.  Very much the attitude of an armed thug rather than an honorable warrior, and not something that Wizards should see as setting a good example to those who look upon it as a role model.",
