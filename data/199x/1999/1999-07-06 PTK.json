Try like a thing the size of a booster box (540 cards) MSRP = $100, and a foil alternate art Xiahou-Dun, the One-Eyed can come automatically for Buy-A-Case Buyers.\n\nThey don't want to destroy the secondary market for cards- reprinting Xiahou-Dun, if it's done at all, needs to be done carefully so we don't repeat the Chronicles/Legends fiasco. It can be done, but not even in From the Vault, or any currently released product. Maybe something special for Gen Con one of these years?  You can knock an UBER OMFG rare down to a Mythic Rare, but not down to uncommon. Not everyone will have a Xiahou-Dun, and that just needs to be lived with.",

   "text_posted": "This card has ONLY been printed in portal three kingdoms. \nPortal three kingdoms, from my sources online had an \"english print run smaller than beta.\" Take a moment to let that sink in. Beta had a print run of 7.3 million cards. Lets say, this has a print run of 7.3 million as well, though according to all sources it has \"less\" (though I have been unable to find one that gives an exact number).\n\nThis set has 10 cards per pack. So 730,000 packs were sold. Each one had 1 rare. So 730,000 total portal three kingdoms rares. There were 55 rares in the set. A total of 13.3k english legal copies of this card ever existed. Except less. Because the print run was less than that of beta. Keep in mind, that means there are more than 66% more[autocard] black lotus[/autocard]es printed than this card. About three times more [autocard]Libraries of Alexandria[/autocard]. This card and other non-reprinted portal rares are the rarest vintage-legal cards in the world.\n\nAll together now: 0_o!!!\n\n(Also the card is practically a staple in any format its legal in, considering its about as good as [autocard]demonic tutor[/autocard].)",
