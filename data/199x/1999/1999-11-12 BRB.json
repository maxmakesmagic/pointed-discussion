(Kinda like [autocard]Daze[/autocard] in [i]Duel Decks Jace v. Chandra[/i] and Swords to Plowshares in [i]Duel Decks Elspeth vs. Tezzeret[/i]). \n\nEven though every single card in the box sets should be just as valued as each other, they aren't, because they're different power levels, and though the box set adds the same number of cards to the market for each, the card's original rarity holds a lot of sway over it's supply and demand, USUALLY. So reprinting cards in Box Sets and retaining their rarity symbols is actually a good way of trying to let people know that some of the cards in the Box are more valuable than others. The only sad thing is that cards like [autocard]Counterspell[/autocard] and [autocard]Demonic Tutor[/autocard] and a scary percent of [i]Premium Deck Series Graveborn[/i] could have all gotten Rare Symbols to help people realize that....umm....Good Cards are Way Good. :D",
