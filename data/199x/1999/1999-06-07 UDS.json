Creatures back then <i>sucked</i>. I know creatures in Urza's Saga were much better than in Unlimited, but they were still far from overpowering non-creature spells like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark Ritual\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dark Ritual\">Dark Ritual</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth's Will\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Yawgmoth's Will\">Yawgmoth's Will</a>.<br /><br />The game is designed to include creature combat. Combat is extremely flavorful and fun, includes very difficult skill-testing decisions, and is filled with opportunities to show off discovered synergies. Not having decent creatures shuts off an important part of the game. In fact, I think it's reasonable to say it's the <i>most important</i> part of the game. The designers and developers today are careful to make both creatures and non-creature spells powerful enough to use.<br /><br />And now for something completely different... You can include an empty tag in the middle of a word to bypass the censoring. It'll look like this, but with square brackets instead of parentheses: (autocard multiverseid=&quot;249365&quot;)Deep An(i)(/i)alysis(/autocard).

   "text_posted": "@Kikke:\nI just watched someone open a pack of Unlimited Edition on a Youtube video. Alongside cards like [autocard]Mox Ruby[/autocard] and [autocard]Sinkhole[/autocard], the pack included [autocard]Ironroot Treefolk[/autocard] and [autocard]Gray Ogre[/autocard]. Creatures back then [i]sucked[/i]. I know creatures in Urza's Saga were much better than in Unlimited, but they were still far from overpowering non-creature spells like [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard] and [autocard]Yawgmoth's Will[/autocard].\n\nThe game is designed to include creature combat. Combat is extremely flavorful and fun, includes very difficult skill-testing decisions, and is filled with opportunities to show off discovered synergies. Not having decent creatures shuts off an important part of the game. In fact, I think it's reasonable to say it's the [i]most important[/i] part of the game. The designers and developers today are careful to make both creatures and non-creature spells powerful enough to use.\n\nAnd now for something completely different... You can include an empty tag in the middle of a word to bypass the censoring. It'll look like this, but with square brackets instead of parentheses: (autocard multiverseid=\"249365\")Deep An(i)(/i)alysis(/autocard).

Taking a look at the art, I'd wager it's some kind of bargain. Some kind of bargain with Yawgmoth.\r<br />\r<br />benzensulfonic writes: &quot;Ok, let's say I'm a noob who just got into MTG.... How is this card (and Necropotence for that matter) helpful to you?&quot;\r<br />\r<br />Let me put it like this. Your life total is generally the primary obstacle your opponent must overcome in order to win the game. Knowing this, new players feel it's important above all else to protect this life total. In effect, they are mostly correct. But there is a saying among the more experienced players that &quot;the only life point that matters is the last one.&quot; That is to say, while it is more perilous to be at 3 life than 20 (what with Lightning Bolts flying around), if you are in a position to defend yourself, it shouldn't matter. What I'm getting at here, is that life is a semi-expendable resource. Experienced players gladly take the hits from their painlands (lands that deal damage to you) to fix their mana. Since early on in the game, players poured their life into <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Channel\">Channel</a> and its ilk to win just a little bit faster. The concept is a little more in-depth than that, but you get the point.\r<br />\r<br />The most valuable resource in this game is card advantage. Lets say you have a spell that reads &quot;Counter target spell. Draw a card&quot;. This means that, when using it, you have used one of your cards to negate one of your opponents cards. Plus, you have replaced the spell you just played with a new card. You have lost nothing, in effect, but your opponent has lost something. You have then gained card advantage over your opponent. Spells like <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Blightning\">Blightning</a> and other discard effects have always been popular because they create this advantage; and card drawing effects are popular for the same reason. When a player has run out of spells in their hand, their options are vastly reduced. The player with more cards available has more control over the state of the board, while the top-decking player has to rely more heavily on the state of the board they have already set up. So in effect, Yawgmoth's Bargain creates a huge amount of this card advantage. You lose nothing of great value, but you get a card. With that, you can be sure that you have a steady flow of creatures, removal, and other such things, when your opponent(s) are &quot;out of gas&quot;, so to speak. The bargain doesn't &quot;win you the game&quot; on it's own. It's what's called an &quot;engine&quot;- a card that enables other cards to work more effectively for you. When played early with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark Ritual\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dark Ritual\">Dark Ritual</a>, this will undoubtably get you the means of winning the game. It will draw you more cards than many new players would expect. More cards equals stronger position.\r<br />\r<br />Hope that helped!",
   "text_posted": "It's time for commenting on the comments again! Huzzah! Lets dip into the mailbag and see what we have...\r\n\r\nGilgamesh3000 asks: \"What's happening in the art?\"\r\n\r\nWell, Gilgamesh, thanks for taking the time away from ruling ancient kingdoms to comment on this card. Taking a look at the art, I'd wager it's some kind of bargain. Some kind of bargain with Yawgmoth.\r\n\r\nbenzensulfonic writes: \"Ok, let's say I'm a noob who just got into MTG.... How is this card (and Necropotence for that matter) helpful to you?\"\r\n\r\nLet me put it like this. Your life total is generally the primary obstacle your opponent must overcome in order to win the game. Knowing this, new players feel it's important above all else to protect this life total. In effect, they are mostly correct. But there is a saying among the more experienced players that \"the only life point that matters is the last one.\" That is to say, while it is more perilous to be at 3 life than 20 (what with Lightning Bolts flying around), if you are in a position to defend yourself, it shouldn't matter. What I'm getting at here, is that life is a semi-expendable resource. Experienced players gladly take the hits from their painlands (lands that deal damage to you) to fix their mana. Since early on in the game, players poured their life into [autocard]Channel[/autocard] and its ilk to win just a little bit faster. The concept is a little more in-depth than that, but you get the point.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable resource in this game is card advantage. Lets say you have a spell that reads \"Counter target spell. Draw a card\". This means that, when using it, you have used one of your cards to negate one of your opponents cards. Plus, you have replaced the spell you just played with a new card. You have lost nothing, in effect, but your opponent has lost something. You have then gained card advantage over your opponent. Spells like [autocard]Blightning[/autocard] and other discard effects have always been popular because they create this advantage; and card drawing effects are popular for the same reason. When a player has run out of spells in their hand, their options are vastly reduced. The player with more cards available has more control over the state of the board, while the top-decking player has to rely more heavily on the state of the board they have already set up. So in effect, Yawgmoth's Bargain creates a huge amount of this card advantage. You lose nothing of great value, but you get a card. With that, you can be sure that you have a steady flow of creatures, removal, and other such things, when your opponent(s) are \"out of gas\", so to speak. The bargain doesn't \"win you the game\" on it's own. It's what's called an \"engine\"- a card that enables other cards to work more effectively for you. When played early with [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard], this will undoubtably get you the means of winning the game. It will draw you more cards than many new players would expect. More cards equals stronger position.\r\n\r\nHope that helped!",
