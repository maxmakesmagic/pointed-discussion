   "text_parsed": "Card of the Week #2<br />Previous card - Deepcavern Imp<br /><br />I love green. I want to say that, because I just do. It's easily my favourite color. So much fun, in a very straight forward way. And really that's what I love about green: it's straight forward. It does simple things, like beat for five, in very nice fun ways. Frankly I think this card is just good and fun. Beats spot removal, beats board wipes and beats face. <br /><br />But that's not even the best part of green, the best part of green is that there is always some sort of fun and cool interactions it has, but it is often ignored because of how straightforward the cards look.<br /><br />While that second point may not be valid with this specific card, as kookster will tell you with that really cool combo he has jury rigged together to kill in a really unpredictable way, I say it still stands with a lot of really cool green cards, and a lot of green in general.<br /><br />But, where can you make this card work in EDH?<br /><br />It serves a function in an Asmira deck. 2GGG: beat five once per turn until an opponent decides to let you pump your general. Repeat. Frankly, while it's doable in the ramp heavy green, its too inefficient.<br /><br />This and other cards like it that either like being in graveyards or refuse to stay in graveyards can find snug little homes in a card advantage focused Child of Alara deck. Frankly, that just sounds kind of dumb. Board wipe. Oh that doesn't bug me, too bad for you. I'll probably wipe again a few turns from now too by the way. That would definitely get old.<br /><br />It's a good reusable target for Tuknir Deathlock. Also a good straight forward beater in Stonebrow, Krosan Hero, Borborygmos, or the host of green generals that just give Gaea's Anthem like affects to your creatures or other EDH decks with generals that really just want to beat face. Frankly this isn't bad in any of those decks, and they would all be fun to play. If I had to chose one of those generals I'd go with Stonebrow, it has a good clear focus, a good repeatable method of dealing damage (beat with trample) and the red green lets you to spice in all sorts of fun little hastey tricks, like Anger or Fires of Yavimaya.<br /><br />Although I think this card is most fun when you really exploit its returning abilities, with things, like I don't know, a sacrifice engine. if you can, in some strange completely unfeasible way, to whip out large swathes of mana, or even infinite mana, in red green black, it combos very nicely with Sek'Kuar, Deathkeeper and Kresh the Bloodbraided. I prefer Sek, because spot removal is very high, and very successful in my play group, so having a cool army of 3/1 hastey's is pretty nifty.<br /><br />Alright, let's pull off this cool little infinite army combo.<br />First, you need Weatherseed Treefolk out.<br />Second, you need a sacrifice engine out. Put cool ones, like blasting station (you're just going to play this guy again, so it untaps), Goblin Bombardment (it costs no mana), and Spawning pit (no cost and make even more tokens)<br />Third, a way to keep playing your sacrifice Weatherseed Treefolk, either something simple and amazing, like the aforementioned deathrender (which is a good way to go as it's just one more card), or some fun infinite mana combo. A google search comes up with some cool ones in red green black. Seriously do it, there are some cool ones.<br />Four, fill the rest of the deck with land and tutors, so you can alsways get your combo started, and find all the pieces.<br />Five, play it, and tell cool stories about attacking all four remaining players in the pod of your local EDH league with infinite 3/1 haster's. Then tell sad stories about how you set it up perfectly but forgot someone had a disk out and wiped all you cool dudes, and get teamed on by everyone else and lost.<br /><br />Bye.",
   "text_posted": "Card of the Week #2\nPrevious card - Deepcavern Imp\n\nI love green. I want to say that, because I just do. It's easily my favourite color. So much fun, in a very straight forward way. And really that's what I love about green: it's straight forward. It does simple things, like beat for five, in very nice fun ways. Frankly I think this card is just good and fun. Beats spot removal, beats board wipes and beats face. \n\nBut that's not even the best part of green, the best part of green is that there is always some sort of fun and cool interactions it has, but it is often ignored because of how straightforward the cards look.\n\nWhile that second point may not be valid with this specific card, as kookster will tell you with that really cool combo he has jury rigged together to kill in a really unpredictable way, I say it still stands with a lot of really cool green cards, and a lot of green in general.\n\nBut, where can you make this card work in EDH?\n\nIt serves a function in an Asmira deck. 2GGG: beat five once per turn until an opponent decides to let you pump your general. Repeat. Frankly, while it's doable in the ramp heavy green, its too inefficient.\n\nThis and other cards like it that either like being in graveyards or refuse to stay in graveyards can find snug little homes in a card advantage focused Child of Alara deck. Frankly, that just sounds kind of dumb. Board wipe. Oh that doesn't bug me, too bad for you. I'll probably wipe again a few turns from now too by the way. That would definitely get old.\n\nIt's a good reusable target for Tuknir Deathlock. Also a good straight forward beater in Stonebrow, Krosan Hero, Borborygmos, or the host of green generals that just give Gaea's Anthem like affects to your creatures or other EDH decks with generals that really just want to beat face. Frankly this isn't bad in any of those decks, and they would all be fun to play. If I had to chose one of those generals I'd go with Stonebrow, it has a good clear focus, a good repeatable method of dealing damage (beat with trample) and the red green lets you to spice in all sorts of fun little hastey tricks, like Anger or Fires of Yavimaya.\n\nAlthough I think this card is most fun when you really exploit its returning abilities, with things, like I don't know, a sacrifice engine. if you can, in some strange completely unfeasible way, to whip out large swathes of mana, or even infinite mana, in red green black, it combos very nicely with Sek'Kuar, Deathkeeper and Kresh the Bloodbraided. I prefer Sek, because spot removal is very high, and very successful in my play group, so having a cool army of 3/1 hastey's is pretty nifty.\n\nAlright, let's pull off this cool little infinite army combo.\nFirst, you need Weatherseed Treefolk out.\nSecond, you need a sacrifice engine out. Put cool ones, like blasting station (you're just going to play this guy again, so it untaps), Goblin Bombardment (it costs no mana), and Spawning pit (no cost and make even more tokens)\nThird, a way to keep playing your sacrifice Weatherseed Treefolk, either something simple and amazing, like the aforementioned deathrender (which is a good way to go as it's just one more card), or some fun infinite mana combo. A google search comes up with some cool ones in red green black. Seriously do it, there are some cool ones.\nFour, fill the rest of the deck with land and tutors, so you can alsways get your combo started, and find all the pieces.\nFive, play it, and tell cool stories about attacking all four remaining players in the pod of your local EDH league with infinite 3/1 haster's. Then tell sad stories about how you set it up perfectly but forgot someone had a disk out and wiped all you cool dudes, and get teamed on by everyone else and lost.\n\nBye.",
