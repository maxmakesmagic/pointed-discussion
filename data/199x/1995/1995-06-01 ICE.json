Nobody should ever mulligan more than 5 times. This is assuming that they allow me the same courtesy. Nothing sucks more than drawing no or 1 land and taking that first free mulligan and its the same. Then you have to draw less and are at a disadvantage all because of bad luck. And besides, nothing will predict what they will draw in the next few turns, so they MUST rely on the consistency of the deck. I don't consider winning because my opponent had no lands to be a victory.<br /><br />Ante was a cool idea but doesn't work. It always makes a loser and gives people fear to play. The game should be about fun and not losing your cards. Ante would also certainly discourage new players who weren't that good, or against them rich kids who have the money to buy 100 boosters and get those black lotuses. If a good card is on the line, it just ruins the entire mood. With ante, you can't just play for fun.

   "text_parsed": "Ice Cauldron can do some pretty wonky stuff when you start messing with its charge counters.  Let's take a look at its normal operation:<br /><br />Step 0 - Play Ice Cauldron<br />Step 1 - Tap Ice Cauldron and pay X mana (X can be zero) to activate its first ability.  Can only be used if Ice Cauldron has no charge counters on it.<br />a.  Exile a card from your hand<br />b.  Put a charge counter on Ice Cauldron<br />c.  Note any many payed towards the activation cost. <br />Step 2 - Tap Ice Cauldron and remove a charge counter to activate its second ability.<br />a.  Add X back to your mana pool.<br /><br />Note that Ice Cauldron retains its notes on the mana last paid to activate its first ability, <i>even if you have already used its second ability</i>.  Normally, this is irrelevant, as its two abilities are mutually exclusive, due to the charge counter requirements on both abilities, so in order to access the second ability you must first override the noted stored mana with another use of the first ability.<br /><br />However, should you start adding or removing charge counters from Ice Cauldron, such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy Chamber\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Energy Chamber\">Energy Chamber</a>, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coretapper\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Coretapper\">Coretapper</a>, or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power Conduit\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Power Conduit\">Power Conduit</a>, Ice Cauldron starts misbehaving.<br /><br />For example, if you exile a card with ice cauldron, then remove Ice Cauldron's charge counter with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power Conduit\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Power Conduit\">Power Conduit</a>, you can keep exiling cards with Ice Cauldron, and cast them from exile whenever you want (obeying normal timing restrictions of course).  The special part of the exile zone dedicated to Ice Cauldron is arguably the safest place to keep your cards... only <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Riftsweeper\">Riftsweeper</a> and <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pull from Eternity\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Pull from Eternity\">Pull from Eternity</a> can access them there.<br /><br />On the other hand, should you start adding charge counters with <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coretapper\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Coretapper\">Coretapper</a>, you can repeatedly use the same mana you paid for the first ability, though only the most recent mana counts  and you can only use it on the most recent card at any given time, so order matters here.

Then next turn, you could remove the charge counter, exile a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane Command\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Profane Command\">Profane Command</a> with extra mana from some <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark Ritual\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dark Ritual\">Dark Ritual</a>s (let's say 10 mana), then add a charge counter and use the <i>same</i> 10 mana for your <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exsanguinate\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Exsanguinate\">Exsanguinate</a> (assuming you either waited a turn or <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Twiddle\">Twiddle</a>d your Ice Cauldron).<br /><br />There's also some weird interactions between Ice Cauldron and cards that mess with your check your mana pool, such as <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omnath\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Omnath\">Omnath</a>.  For example, you could tap Ice Cauldron to exile a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squall Line\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Squall Line\">Squall Line</a>, paying 3 green mana in the process.  Next turn, you can add a charge counter to Ice Cauldron, float 3 green mana with the Cauldron, and give <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omnath\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Omnath\">Omnath</a> +3/+3.  This mana continues to stick around, though it can only be used toward casting <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squall Line\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Squall Line\">Squall Line</a>.  You can continue doing this every turn, causing Ice Cauldron to become a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded Lotus\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Gilded Lotus\">Gilded Lotus</a> that can only be used to cast <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squall Line\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Squall Line\">Squall Line</a> and pump <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omnath\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Omnath\">Omnath</a>.

   "text_posted": "Ice Cauldron can do some pretty wonky stuff when you start messing with its charge counters.  Let's take a look at its normal operation:\n\nStep 0 - Play Ice Cauldron\nStep 1 - Tap Ice Cauldron and pay X mana (X can be zero) to activate its first ability.  Can only be used if Ice Cauldron has no charge counters on it.\na.  Exile a card from your hand\nb.  Put a charge counter on Ice Cauldron\nc.  Note any many payed towards the activation cost. \nStep 2 - Tap Ice Cauldron and remove a charge counter to activate its second ability.\na.  Add X back to your mana pool.\n\nNote that Ice Cauldron retains its notes on the mana last paid to activate its first ability, [i]even if you have already used its second ability[/i].  Normally, this is irrelevant, as its two abilities are mutually exclusive, due to the charge counter requirements on both abilities, so in order to access the second ability you must first override the noted stored mana with another use of the first ability.\n\nHowever, should you start adding or removing charge counters from Ice Cauldron, such as [autocard]Energy Chamber[/autocard], [autocard]Coretapper[/autocard], or [autocard]Power Conduit[/autocard], Ice Cauldron starts misbehaving.\n\nFor example, if you exile a card with ice cauldron, then remove Ice Cauldron's charge counter with [autocard]Power Conduit[/autocard], you can keep exiling cards with Ice Cauldron, and cast them from exile whenever you want (obeying normal timing restrictions of course).  The special part of the exile zone dedicated to Ice Cauldron is arguably the safest place to keep your cards... only [autocard]Riftsweeper[/autocard] and [autocard]Pull from Eternity[/autocard] can access them there.\n\nOn the other hand, should you start adding charge counters with [autocard]Coretapper[/autocard], you can repeatedly use the same mana you paid for the first ability, though only the most recent mana counts  and you can only use it on the most recent card at any given time, so order matters here.  This could be useful if you exiled multiple cards, as outlined above. for instance, you could exile an [autocard]Exsanguinate[/autocard] for 0 mana.  Then next turn, you could remove the charge counter, exile a [autocard]Profane Command[/autocard] with extra mana from some [autocard]Dark Ritual[/autocard]s (let's say 10 mana), then add a charge counter and use the [i]same[/i] 10 mana for your [autocard]Exsanguinate[/autocard] (assuming you either waited a turn or [autocard]Twiddle[/autocard]d your Ice Cauldron).\n\nThere's also some weird interactions between Ice Cauldron and cards that mess with your check your mana pool, such as [autocard]Omnath[/autocard].  For example, you could tap Ice Cauldron to exile a [autocard]Squall Line[/autocard], paying 3 green mana in the process.  Next turn, you can add a charge counter to Ice Cauldron, float 3 green mana with the Cauldron, and give [autocard]Omnath[/autocard] +3/+3.  This mana continues to stick around, though it can only be used toward casting [autocard]Squall Line[/autocard].

   "text_parsed": "@zenitramleirdag: just a guess, but: in the lower center, you see the clock, with some additional cogwheels, that do the timer. It seems to be inside a glass vat of some sort. On the very bottom left and bottom right, you see the explosives, which are connected to the glass vat with the timer. What the skeleton is doing in there I'm not sure. Maybe it was the engineer of the bomb, who was imprisoned in it, once he completed it for some lord of some sort? It seems he tried to escape using this red sphere to smash the upper right corner of the vat, but didn't make it out himself. Maybe the hole was too small, or he was too weak already, or stuck in the cogwheels. I guess the sphere was a not very relevant part of the bomb?<br /><br />In the background there is just a meadow with mountain ranges, and if you look very closely, you can see a city at the foot of the mountain range. With a gate, walls and houses. I guess everyone in the city is asleep, what with the windows beeing dark. And a starlight sky above.<br /><br />Quite surreal all in all. I like it. The background adds a feeling of serenity, with the starlit sky, the meadow and the city all asleep. The bomb in the foreground adds a feeling of suspense, with the explosives and the timer. And the skeleton adds some slight horror.<br /><br />While beeing slow, the card has it's advantages. Unlike most other bomb type cards, you don't have to tap it to add a counter, so you can always pop it in response to removal. Having just one mana as an activation cost helps. And since it can also finish off players, it might seem irrelevant at first, but becomes a hard to deal with threat in longer games.

   "text_posted": "@zenitramleirdag: just a guess, but: in the lower center, you see the clock, with some additional cogwheels, that do the timer. It seems to be inside a glass vat of some sort. On the very bottom left and bottom right, you see the explosives, which are connected to the glass vat with the timer. What the skeleton is doing in there I'm not sure. Maybe it was the engineer of the bomb, who was imprisoned in it, once he completed it for some lord of some sort? It seems he tried to escape using this red sphere to smash the upper right corner of the vat, but didn't make it out himself. Maybe the hole was too small, or he was too weak already, or stuck in the cogwheels. I guess the sphere was a not very relevant part of the bomb?\n\nIn the background there is just a meadow with mountain ranges, and if you look very closely, you can see a city at the foot of the mountain range. With a gate, walls and houses. I guess everyone in the city is asleep, what with the windows beeing dark. And a starlight sky above.\n\nQuite surreal all in all. I like it. The background adds a feeling of serenity, with the starlit sky, the meadow and the city all asleep. The bomb in the foreground adds a feeling of suspense, with the explosives and the timer. And the skeleton adds some slight horror.\n\nWhile beeing slow, the card has it's advantages. Unlike most other bomb type cards, you don't have to tap it to add a counter, so you can always pop it in response to removal. Having just one mana as an activation cost helps. And since it can also finish off players, it might seem irrelevant at first, but becomes a hard to deal with threat in longer games. And with cards such as doubling season, time warp or paradox haze, the number of counters can become relevant quicky.",

An obvious comparison for this is <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Instill Energy\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Instill Energy\">Instill Energy</a>. Instill Energy is 2 cheaper, and gives a free untap every single turn, vs a much more expensive instant which happens to give actual haste, and gives you a card. So, one extra mana for the ability to play it instantly, which plays into the whole playing against an enemy and not for the most efficient thing, and then one extra mana for the card at the next turn's upkeep.

You can't do it earlier since attacking is different from tapping/using mana abilities). Tap the Elvish Archdruid for 5, tap him again for another 5. There's a total of 10 green mana in your mana pool. Of course, you're not going to get 4 llanowar's like that. And, assuming you drew turn 1, you have 1 card available to play. If you didn't, that 10 mana is useless, but turns into 17+ Turn 4.\r<br />Touch of Vitae\r<br />Turn 1, Forest, Llanowar Elf.\r<br />Turn 2, Forest, Llanowar, Llanowar, Llanowar.\r<br />Turn 3, Forest, Archdruid. Touch of Vitae, tap for 5, untap, tap again for another 5. You now have 11 mana, with 0 or 1 card(s). Also note, Turn 4 will give you only 12 mana. Yes, that's 5 less. Oh, by the way, that's 12 mana. With one card card advantage.\r<br />\r<br />Of course, that's one example. the likelihood of having 3 Llanowar Elves turn 1, is, I know, lower than having 3 Llanowar elves turn 2. You can reduce the number of Llanowar's by 1, then they become equal, excluding the one card advantage that Touch has, and the turn 4+ mana advantage Instill has. I'm not even going to try factoring in other things, like kill cards or non-mana ramp decks, or anything else. It is definitely not the best card, I just want you to know, this card is better than 2.5, for sure.\r<br />Seriously. <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning Blast\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lightning Blast\">Lightning Blast</a>, which is 3 colorless, one red, which does one more than <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning Bolt\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Lightning Bolt\">Lightning Bolt</a>, but costs 3 more colorless...? I don't really want to compare more, or argue that, but this card is 3+. So is Instill. It could be situationally amazing, and it could be bad. Lots of cards can be very bad if they aren't placed in the right deck, like putting Storm Crow in a mono black deck, or putting Chimney Imp and Storm Crow and Wood Elemental in a mono white deck. Doesn't mean the card's bad if the deck is.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, I decided to do a second comparison. This is without heavy mana producing, just simple stuff. As you can see, the mana cost weighs heavily. As in, VERY heavily.\r<br />Turn 1, Forest, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds of Paradise\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Birds of Paradise\">Birds of Paradise</a>.\r<br />Turn 2, Forest, Instill Energy, Any 3 card cost with 2 green/colorless and one of any color.\r<br />Or,\r<br />Turn 2, Forest, Any 2 card cost with 1 green/colorless and one of any color. Instill energy that creature for an early attack. My advice, use a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pygmy Hippo\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Pygmy Hippo\">Pygmy Hippo</a>, and then steal whatever mana the enemy has. Could be 1, could be 2, could be a dead one drop, could be a dead pygmy and a dead 2 drop, could be a defender blocking.\r<br />\r<br />Touch of Vitae\r<br />T1 Forest, Bird,\r<br />T2 Forest, ....nothing\r<br />T3 Forest, Bird, touch of vitae, tap the bird twice.... very depressing.\r<br />\r<br />This can be broken down extremely simply. Instill energy pays for itself on the first turn on a mana producer, and has that availability on being placed on something aggressively to attack. Touch of vitae does not pay for itself if placed on a small mana producer, and you are essentially only paying for that extra card. It's situational. Not strictly worse. And not strictly bad.",

You can reduce the number of Llanowar's by 1, then they become equal, excluding the one card advantage that Touch has, and the turn 4+ mana advantage Instill has. I'm not even going to try factoring in other things, like kill cards or non-mana ramp decks, or anything else. It is definitely not the best card, I just want you to know, this card is better than 2.5, for sure.\r\nSeriously. [autocard]Lightning Blast[/autocard], which is 3 colorless, one red, which does one more than [autocard]Lightning Bolt[/autocard], but costs 3 more colorless...? I don't really want to compare more, or argue that, but this card is 3+. So is Instill. It could be situationally amazing, and it could be bad. Lots of cards can be very bad if they aren't placed in the right deck, like putting Storm Crow in a mono black deck, or putting Chimney Imp and Storm Crow and Wood Elemental in a mono white deck. Doesn't mean the card's bad if the deck is.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I decided to do a second comparison. This is without heavy mana producing, just simple stuff. As you can see, the mana cost weighs heavily. As in, VERY heavily.\r\nTurn 1, Forest, [autocard]Birds of Paradise[/autocard].\r\nTurn 2, Forest, Instill Energy, Any 3 card cost with 2 green/colorless and one of any color.\r\nOr,\r\nTurn 2, Forest, Any 2 card cost with 1 green/colorless and one of any color. Instill energy that creature for an early attack. My advice, use a [autocard]Pygmy Hippo[/autocard], and then steal whatever mana the enemy has. Could be 1, could be 2, could be a dead one drop, could be a dead pygmy and a dead 2 drop, could be a defender blocking.\r\n\r\nTouch of Vitae\r\nT1 Forest, Bird,\r\nT2 Forest, ....nothing\r\nT3 Forest, Bird, touch of vitae, tap the bird twice.... very depressing.\r\n\r\nThis can be broken down extremely simply. Instill energy pays for itself on the first turn on a mana producer, and has that availability on being placed on something aggressively to attack. Touch of vitae does not pay for itself if placed on a small mana producer, and you are essentially only paying for that extra card. It's situational. Not strictly worse. And not strictly bad.",

Some, like the Circles of Protection, they just copied over with new art, but some they made functional reprints of.",
