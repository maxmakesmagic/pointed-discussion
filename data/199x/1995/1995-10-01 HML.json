Well, when generating the card for today’s writing, the randomizer recommended a <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Plains\">Plains</a>, the Fred Fields on from <i>Starter 2000</i>.

There is only a single mono-green card with natural banding, <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timber Wolves\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Timber Wolves\">Timber Wolves</a>, a rare color-shifted <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish Hero\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Benalish Hero\">Benalish Hero</a>. Banding is, and was, white. The green mana on the card makes no design sense.\r<br />\r<br />Does it make flavor sense? Who knows? I doubt it. The art, type line, and flavor text attempt to tell a story of heroes that dress up as bears and perform good deeds. I get that the green activation is meant to signify the donning of costume, but again, the banding payoff is neither green nor beast-like.

If there’s anything that can make banding more of a headache than it is normally, that would be granting it to creatures mid-combat. There’s no benefit to not having it, so the decision isn’t even an interesting one. (Read the Oracle reminder text if you need a refresher on how the mechanic works.)\r<br />\r<br />Lastly, this card is a rare.

Maybe the weirdness of the activation made the card so hard for designers and developers to process that they made it a rare.\r<br />\r<br />To make it all worse than it already seems, the better-executed version of this card appeared in the set <i><b>prior</b></i>: <i>Ice Age</i>’s <a href=\"/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dire Wolves\" class=\"autoCard\" data:cardname=\"Dire Wolves\">Dire Wolves</a>. The Wolves are green and have banding (a white ability) as long as you control a Plains (the white land). That makes sense. There is no activation—it’s either on or it’s off. They are three mana (only a single green, making them easier to cast in a green-white deck), are 2/2, and are common.

You get to refill your hand at instant speed, and because of the way mono-white works, you need cards more than your opponents need cards.

   "text_posted": "If you are playing mono-white EDH/Commander, then this card is good.\n\nMono-white has the distinct disadvantage of having almost nothing in the way of card draw. You try to get ahead in the early game and stay ahead, but without cards in the midgame you start to fall off.\n\nThat's where cards like Howling Mine, Mikokoro, and Truce come in handy. You get to refill your hand at instant speed, and because of the way mono-white works, you need cards more than your opponents need cards.

What do you call [autocard]City of Brass[/autocard]?\n\nThe problem with these cards was that Alpha(1) style dual lands were available in Revised and everyone had them when Homelands was released. When Revised run out Wizards started to make non-english editions of Magic and what did they print in them: Alpha style dual lands. So Alpha style dual lands were everywhere. Making three color deck with Alpha style dual lands is very easy.\n\nBut like I wrote in another of these lands: one must remember that these taught Wizards how not to make trilands.\n\n(1) OK, Beta style if you count that [autocard]Volcanic Island[/autocard] was not in Alpha.\n\n\nHere's the correct multiland (including lands that not necessarily produce multiple colors of mana but help otherways to diversify mana production) story up until Homelands:\n\nAlpha, Beta, Unlimited and Revised: Original dual lamds ([autocard]Badlands[/autocard] etc. Alpha was missing [autocard]Volcanic Island[/autocard]).\nArabian Nights: [autocard]City of Brass[/autocard].\nAntiquities: No color producing lands.\nLegends: No multilands.\nThe Dark: No color producing lands.\nFallen Empires: [autocard]Rainbow Vale[/autocard].\nFourth edition: No multilands.\nIce Age: Allied color painlands ([autocard]Adarkar Wastes[/autocard] etc.) and taplands ([autocard]Land Cap[/autocard] etc.)\nChronicles: [autocard]City of Brass[/autocard].\nHomelands: These\n\nAs I have time let's see what was coming in the future:\n\nAlliances: [autocard]School of the Unseen[/autocard] and  [autocard]Thawing Glaciers[/autocard].\nMirage: Allied color comes in tapped fetchlands ([autocard]Bad River[/autocard] etc.)\nVisions: [autocard]Undiscovered Paradise[/autocard].\nFifth edition: [autocard]City of Brass[/autocard] and Ice Age painlands ([autocard]Adarkar Wastes[/autocard] etc.)\nWeatherlight: [autocard]Gemstone Mine[/autocard] and [autocard]Lotus Vale[/autocard].\nTempest:  [autocard]Reflecting Pool[/autocard], allied color taplands ([autocard]Cinder Marsh[/autocard] etc.) and comes in tapped painlands ([autocard]Caldera Lake[/autocard] etc.)\nStronghold: No color producing lands.\nExodus: No color producing lands.\nUrza's Saga: [autocard]Thran Quarry[/autocard].\nUrza's Legacy: No multilands.\nSixth edition: [autocard]City of Brass[/autocard] and Ice Age painlands ([autocard]Adarkar Wastes[/autocard] etc.)\nUrza's Destiny: No color producing lands.\nMercadian Masques: [autocard]Henge of Ramos[/autocard].\nNemesis: No color producing lands.\nProphecy: [autocard]Rhystic Cave[/autocard].\nInvasion:  [autocard]Archaeological Dig[/autocard], tri color comes in tapped saclands ([autocard]Ancient Spring[/autocard] etc.) and allied color comes in tapped lands ([autocard]Coastal Tower[/autocard] etc.)\nPlaneshift: [autocard]Forsaken City[/autocard],  [autocard]Meteor Crater[/autocard], [autocard]Terminal Moraine[/autocard] and tri color lairs ([autocard]Crosis's Catacombs[/autocard] etc.)\n\nThat being the first colorfeast block I stop here and continue in [autocard]Darigaaz's Caldera[/autocard].",
