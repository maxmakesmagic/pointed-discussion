   "text_posted": "With the infinite mana combos in Legacy and Vintage these days, it makes sense that this has a tap effect.\nIt's still a bit overpriced for my tastes, though. Maybe have the casting cost go to {4}, keep the {8}, {T} and maybe deal 5 damage? I dunno. It needs more testing. Plus, based on the flavor text and the fact that thing Ring seems to have to do with that actual story (The Arabian Nights, I mean), it seems like it should have some kind of black hate, or at least non-white hate. If it did, then it could be like this:\n\nAladdin's Ring {4}\nArtifact\n{8}, {T}: Aladdin's Ring deals 4 damage to target non-white creature. Tap that creature.\n\nJust a thought. ",

It can't just be that they simply enjoy other methods of play, depending on the situation (possibly including Ante, when consented to by all players), because there is only one right way to play the game, and that's your way. And only wusses would ever mulligan, or let an opponent mulligan, because the only acceptable way to play this game of strategy is to gamble on the games, and then allow chance to skew the results to an irrecoverable degree. Anyone who has any opinion other than this single view is clearly inferior.<br /><br />While we're at it, lets do away with those silly ban lists, restricted lists, the increased minimum deck size, and most certainly that four-copies-per-card limit. Constructed deck restrictions aren't what Magic is about, after all, and that surely holds true even with modern cards, because the game hasn't massively changed over the years at all, right?

It can't just be that they simply enjoy other methods of play, depending on the situation (possibly including Ante, when consented to by all players), because there is only one right way to play the game, and that's your way. And only wusses would ever mulligan, or let an opponent mulligan, because the only acceptable way to play this game of strategy is to gamble on the games, and then allow chance to skew the results to an irrecoverable degree.

This, on the other hand, fixes your mana as a strictly-worse mana cyclix, that sets you behind 3 mana and a card for casting it, then one mana (it costs 2 and produces 1) for each activation. Instead of the normal gain in tempo from being able to cast better spells more reliably, you lose tempo trying to meet this mana requirement! It costs 5 mana to play and activate this once. By that point, and at this time, you should have all the colors you need out without this, because of all the duals. ",

It may be bad overall, but I have won casual games using this to accelerate into creatures like Yukora, the Prisoner, and Iwamori of the Open Fist. It does do a (admittedly, bad) job of accelerating you in some decks. This, on the other hand, fixes your mana as a strictly-worse mana cyclix, that sets you behind 3 mana and a card for casting it, then one mana (it costs 2 and produces 1) for each activation. Instead of the normal gain in tempo from being able to cast better spells more reliably, you lose tempo trying to meet this mana requirement! It costs 5 mana to play and activate this once. By that point, and at this time, you should have all the colors you need out without this, because of all the duals. ",

(What, you thought basic lands were strictly for beginners?) It was probably anticipated that anyone with more than two colors would need this sort of help...as long as they were willing to deal with the inherent tempo loss. It wasn't expected that games would be at breakneck speed, anyway--the whole Black Lotus/Channel/Mountain/Fireball|Disintegrate situation took them by surprise, I believe.\n\n@Darth Parallax: Stalking Stones...? I think you meant [autocard]Standing Stones[/autocard]...which doesn't really have meaning nowadays, except as a stepping stone towards Mana Prism. (No pun intended.)\n",

These were fantastic and horrific claims made about how Satanists rule the country, use the friendlier Pagans as recruitment pools, and sacrifice tens of thousands of women and children each year, with the police willfully ignoring such.  This was eventually forgotten, fifteen seconds after the millions of dollars and many ruined lives failed to bring up any evidence for anything, and census data made it clear that America would be a giant ghost town if Satanists were really killing people in those numbers, or, as the Church of Satan pointed out, Satanists actually even sacrifice people.  (They don't, and neither do Pagans.)   But in the early and mid nineties, being attached to anything supernatural wasn't a smart career move, especially as novel and unestablished as MtG was.  More so, if, like MtG, you really have nothing to do with actual occultism.    (I'm Pagan, so I know this stuff.)<br /><br />In conclusion:  Magic might have suffered without pulling the original art, more even than we are suffering with this absurd fix.  <br /><br />Also:  The version of the pentagram used in the alpha art is venerated by LaVeyan Satanists, who, generally speaking, would find no problem associating their symbol with &quot;unholy strength.&quot;",

These were fantastic and horrific claims made about how Satanists rule the country, use the friendlier Pagans as recruitment pools, and sacrifice tens of thousands of women and children each year, with the police willfully ignoring such.  This was eventually forgotten, fifteen seconds after the millions of dollars and many ruined lives failed to bring up any evidence for anything, and census data made it clear that America would be a giant ghost town if Satanists were really killing people in those numbers, or, as the Church of Satan pointed out, Satanists actually even sacrifice people.  (They don't, and neither do Pagans.)   But in the early and mid nineties, being attached to anything supernatural wasn't a smart career move, especially as novel and unestablished as MtG was.  More so, if, like MtG, you really have nothing to do with actual occultism.    (I'm Pagan, so I know this stuff.)\n\nIn conclusion:  Magic might have suffered without pulling the original art, more even than we are suffering with this absurd fix.  \n\nAlso:  The version of the pentagram used in the alpha art is venerated by LaVeyan Satanists, who, generally speaking, would find no problem associating their symbol with \"unholy strength.\"",

The 5 colors shouldn't be so predictable and limited, to the point where you know exactly how it's going to go down when you've seen a couple islands hit the table.\n\nRed doesn't need to just be burn spells, swarms of ugly goblins, and annoying \"haste\" creatures you can never block.\nGreen doesn't have to be limited to undercosted trample creatures, irritating swarms of 1/1 insects, and \"artwork\" that hurts your eyes.\nAnd so on.

Unless your opponent is playing tons of flyers, a Blaze will usually be more helpful to you than a Hurricane.

After all, why would the White Ward just destroy itself instantly after you cast it on a creature? So, OK, the newer White Ward text clears up this little technicality... but what I don't understand is why they printed the same \"the protection granted by X Ward does not destroy X Ward\"... on all four of the other color wards! They're not giving protection from white! They can't destroy themselves at all!! Printing redundant text like that is very confusing to a new player.",

   "text_posted": "What would make Legacy better...\nLegalize this in the format. Ban [autocard]Crucible Of Worlds[/autocard] for being an abusive engine. Ban [autocard]Blight[/autocard] and [autocard]Ghost Quarter[/autocard] for being bad. Legacy as it is now for blue mages is : Play a fetch land. Sacrifice for an Island to cast Daze if they have a Wasteland. Stall for the beginning of the game with [autocard]Standstill[/autocard]. Strip Mine would fix the format from decks that STALL. Strip Mine is -needed- in Legacy. Badly. There is a large number of very noble cards on teh Legacy banned list. [autocard]Gush[/autocard], [autocard]Black Vise[/autocard], [autocard]Balance[/autocard], [autocard]Strip Mine[/autocard]. Why the hell do they unban [autocard]Grim Monolith[/autocard] and [autocard]TImespiral[/autocard] ? The format is full of the worst offenders and yet cards at common and uncommon rarity which need engines to be broken are banned? Are the people in charge of Legacy smoking crack? And yes I'm aware of what [autocard]Stasis[/autocard] does with [autocard]Gush[/autocard]. Stasis is unfun enough to be banned. Strip Mine is a fair balanced card one of the best cards in the game in terms of balancing, a true great equalizer.
