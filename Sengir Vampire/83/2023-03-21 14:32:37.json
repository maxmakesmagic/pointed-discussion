This was before Interview with a Vampire and Twilight made kids think that Vampires should look sexy. And it was before WotC had to worry about pleasing the masses. They let the artists inject such originality into their new world and created a unique flavor for their unique game. it would have been much less risky to stick with boring, classic, archetypal fantasy art, but they rolled the dice with a lot of early art and hit a home run. There is no doubt what the color black represents in *this* game: these vampires are deranged, evil creatures of the night. Anson Maddocks did as much to define the early flavor of Magic as anyone.",
