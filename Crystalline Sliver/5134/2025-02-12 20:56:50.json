Just have Magma Sliver and a sacrifice outlet (There's a sliver for that!) to retire the Crystalline when you've had your fill of sweet, sweet dread, wafting over from the other side of the table. Yes. They're evil. As long as it's never the only deck you bring with you, your soul can still be saved. 5/5",
