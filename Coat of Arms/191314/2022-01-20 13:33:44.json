Unfortunately, Coat of Arms usually sees play in decks built around swarming the board, and as such, it greatly overpowers the opposition. It can turn a board of 1/1s into powerhouses that should never be that powerful for how easy it is to generate tokens and play this passive buff. Much hatred for cards that enable easy mode.",
