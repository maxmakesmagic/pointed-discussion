Big creatures are particularly exciting for newer players, so I've got a feeling that these decks will go over really well with casual players like myself.  \n  \nHonestly, I'm pumped to plunk down the $25 or $30 to enjoy an afternoon battling back and forth with a friend. The best part is, these decks are perfect for teaching new players how to play the game, and both decks just *beg* to be tweaked and upgraded, so the fun lasts a whole lot longer than the original decks ever will.",
