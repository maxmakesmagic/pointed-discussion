First of all, it's a 5/7: a really beefy creature. It puts your opponent on a 4-turn clock, and can block titans without dying(with [Inferno Titan](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno Titan)'s [firebreathing](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=firebreathing) as an exception). Secondly, this thing has reach, so this guy can pick off [Delver](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver)s and all sorts of fliers(I don't think there's one in limited right now that's actually big enough to bring this thing down without pump spells, even the [Falkenrath Aristocrat](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath Aristocrat) would require some human sacrifices to do it.) Lastly, this guy's ability is just AMAZING. It's great for green control, which is something I don't see a lot of. You can reuse your [Arachnus Web](/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus Web) over and over and over and OVER again, webbing down their weenies and even their fatties, as long as you reattach the web right after it falls off at...
